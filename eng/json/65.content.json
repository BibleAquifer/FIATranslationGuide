    "content": "<h2>Hear and Heart</h2>\n<h2>Hear and Heart</h2><p>In this step, hear Jude 1–2 and put it in your hearts.</p><p>First, listen to an audio version of Jude as a whole. Then, listen again to an audio version of Jude 1–2. Listen to this smaller section three times, in three different translations, if possible.</p><p>Pause this audio here.</p><p>Then, as a group, discuss the following questions:</p><ol><li><p>What do you like in this passage? Pause this audio here.</p></li><li><p>What do you not like or not understand in this passage? Pause this audio here.</p></li><li><p>What does this passage tell us about God, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit? Pause this audio here.</p></li><li><p>What does this passage tell us about people?

Jude says he is the brother of James. James is a common name, but this James was probably an important leader in the church in Jerusalem. We have heard about James in the book of Acts. This James was actually a younger brother of Jesus, or better said, a half brother: a son of Jesus&apos; mother Mary and her husband Joseph. Jude must therefore also have been a younger brother of Jesus. But Jude does not tell us that. Jude says he is a servant, or slave, of Jesus Christ. Jesus is Jude&apos;s master, and Jude&apos;s Saviour and king. Everything that Jude does and says, Jude does because Jesus wants Jude to do this.</p><p>Stop here and discuss this question as a group: When you introduce yourself to other people, what do you say about yourself? What is the first thing you ask when you meet a new person? Pause this audio here.</p><p>Jude does not say the names of the people to whom Jude is writing. But Jude must have sent the letter to a particular church, or to several churches. Jude was worried about these churches, as we will see later. Jude&apos;s letter is like a sermon. Through Jude&apos;s sermon, Jude wants the people to change.</p><p>Jude wants many people to hear his sermon, because Jude is worried that some people are spreading a dangerous teaching in these churches. These people are saying that it does not matter how we behave, because God has already saved us anyway. We will talk more about this later.</p><p>Jude greets the people who read Jude&apos;s letter, or who listen to his sermon. Jude says that God has called these people. This means that God has invited these people to become God&apos;s children. God loves these people very much, and God keeps them safe for Jesus Christ. This probably means that God will make sure that when Jesus comes back, these people will still be followers of Jesus.</p><p>Jude then says that Jude wishes that the people who listen to Jude&apos;s letter will have very much mercy, peace, and love. Mercy means goodness and compassion. Jude wants God to be very good to the people, and for God to have much compassion for the people. When people have peace, they live in harmony with God and with each other. Jude wishes that the people will have <em>much</em> peace, meaning that the people will very much live in harmony. Jude also wishes the people much love: Jude wants God to love the people very much. Or maybe Jude wants the people to be really sure that God loves the people, and that the people will feel God&apos;s love very much.</p><p>Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your community, what are the things that people wish for each other? If someone wishes you well, what are the things that person would say to you? Pause this audio here.</p><p>This ends the introduction in Jude&apos;s letter. In the next passage, we will hear why Jude is writing this letter.</p>\n<h2>Defining the Scenes</h2>\n<h2>Defining the Scenes</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 1–2 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.</p><p>This passage has one part.</p><p>In this part, we hear who is writing this letter, and to whom.</p><p>The characters in this passage are:</p><ul><li><p>Jude</p></li><li><p>James, the brother of Jude</p></li><li><p>God the father</p></li><li><p>Jesus Christ</p></li><li><p>The people to whom Jude is writing</p></li><li><p>Probably, someone who is writing the letter while Jude tells that person what to write</p></li><li><p>And someone who is reading the letter out loud to the people later</p></li></ul><p>This book is a letter. It was normal for people who wrote a letter at that time to first say who they were, then to say to whom they were writing, and then to say something good that they hoped would happen to the people that they were writing to. This was the opening of the letter. The main part of the letter would come after this. Jude also begins Jude&apos;s letter in this way.</p><p>Jude begins by saying two things about himself: Jude is a slave of Jesus Christ, and Jude is a brother of James. Jude was probably a <em>younger</em> brother of James.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: How would you like to begin this passage so that your listeners will know that this is a letter? Do you want to say something like, &quot;This is a letter from Jude, who is a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James?&quot; Or, &quot;I, Jude, am writing this letter. I am a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James.&quot; Discuss what sounds most natural in your language. Pause the audio here.</p><p>Jude then says three things about the people to whom Jude writes. Jude does not give these people&apos;s names, but Jude says that God has called these people, and that God loves them. Then Jude says that God keeps these people safe for Jesus, or perhaps, that God keeps them safe until Jesus will return.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you can say these three things about the people. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Jude then wishes three things for Jude&apos;s listeners: mercy, peace, and love. Jude wishes that these people will have very much of these things.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you can talk about these three wishes. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Try to say the whole passage now. Remember that Jude said two things about himself, three things about the people, and three wishes for the people. Maybe you can clap to help you remember how many things Jude says each time? You can also make a storyboard or use objects. Do this activity now.</p>\n<h2>Embodying the Text</h2>\n<h2>Embodying the Text</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 1–2 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.</p><p>This passage has one part.</p><p>The characters in this passage are:</p><ul><li><p>Jude</p></li><li><p>James, the brother of Jude</p></li><li><p>God the father</p></li><li><p>Jesus Christ</p></li><li><p>The people to whom Jude is writing</p></li><li><p>Probably, someone who is writing the letter while Jude tells this person what to write</p></li><li><p>And someone who is reading the letter out loud to the people later</p></li></ul><p>As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language. Here are some ideas that can help you to act out the passage:</p><p>You could act out Jude writing the letter. Many people in that time did not know how to write, and other people wrote for these people. Jude was maybe walking around, thinking about what Jude wanted to say in Jude&apos;s letter, and someone else, who was able to write, wrote down what Jude said.</p><p>Remember that Jude was worried about the people, because there were some people who were preaching dangerous, false things to the people.</p><p>Once the whole letter was completed, Jude would give the letter to someone who would take it to the people. Most likely, this was a person who was able to read. Jude would make sure that this person understood the letter and was able to read it well, and that this person could also explain the letter if people had questions about the letter. It could even be that the messenger was the same person as the person who wrote the letter for Jude.</p><p>You could act out the messenger taking this letter to the other people, and reading the letter out loud to those people. You could act out that people are listening to the messenger reading the letter. You could also act out that God had called the people to whom Jude is writing, so that those people could become followers of Jesus. You could act out that God loves these people very much and protects the people. You could act out that Jesus is coming back, and that God gives the people to Jesus, because God kept the people safe. This is what is going to happen in the future. Of course, you can think of other ways to act out this passage as well.</p><p>Pause this audio here and act out the passage.</p><p>The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, &quot;What are you feeling or thinking?&quot; The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.</p><p>Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.</p><p>The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.</p><p>Act out Jude thinking about what Jude is going to write. Act out that Jude writes, or tells someone to write, the beginning of this letter. You may say something like this:</p><p>&quot;This is a letter from me, Jude. I am a servant of Jesus Christ, and I am the brother of James.</p><p>I am writing to all of you. God the father has chosen you and loves you. And God keeps you safe. He does that through Jesus Christ.</p><p>I am praying for you. I pray that God will bless you and be very kind to you, and that he will give you peace, and that he will love you very much!&quot;</p><p>Pause the drama.</p><p>Ask the actor playing Jude, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; You may hear something like:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;I am very worried because there are some people who are spreading wrong teachings. I have to send letters to churches so that the people will be careful, and will not believe this wrong teaching;&quot; or</p></li><li><p>&quot;I am so glad that God has called so many people and loves them so much, and I know that God will protect the people from this wrong teaching;&quot; or</p></li><li><p>&quot;I really want God to do good things for the other believers.&quot;</p></li></ul><p>Ask the actors playing the people who listen to the letter, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; You may hear things like:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;We are glad to hear from Jude. We look forward to hearing what Jude has to tell us!&quot; or</p></li><li><p>&quot;We are so glad that God has called us, and that God keeps us safe! We are glad about the good things that Jude wishes for us.&quot;</p></li></ul>\n<h2>Filling the Gaps</h2>\n<h2>Filling the Gaps</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 1–2 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.</p><p>Jude is a <strong>servant</strong>, or a slave, of Jesus Christ. A servant is someone who works for someone else.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will say that Jude is a <strong>servant</strong>, or slave, of Jesus Christ. Use the same word as you have used in other passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186482\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">servant</span> is in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.</p><p><strong>Christ</strong> is the same as <strong>Messiah</strong>, the special king and Savior that God had promised to send.</p><p>Stop here and discuss what word you will use for <strong>Christ</strong>. Use the same word as you have used in other passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186574\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Christ</span> is in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Jude wishes that the people will have much mercy, love, and peace. The word <strong>mercy</strong> means goodness, kindness, or compassion. Jude means that Jude wishes that God will show much goodness, kindness, or compassion to the believers.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will say that Jude wishes that people will have much <strong>mercy</strong>. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186537\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">mercy</span> is in the Master Glossary. Use the same word as you have used in other passages. Pause this audio here.</p><p>To <strong>love</strong> someone means to care for someone very much. If you love someone, you want to do things that are good for the other person. Jude wishes that God will love the believers very much.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will say that Jude wishes that the people will have much <strong>love</strong>. Use the same word as you have used in other passages. Pause this audio here.</p><p>When people live in <strong>peace</strong>, those people are completely well. Those people have a complete life, and are living in harmony with each other, with nature, and most importantly, with God! Someone who lives in peace is content. Jude wishes that the people will have much peace. Jude wishes that the people have a good relationship with God and with each other.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will say that Jude wishes that people will have much <strong>peace</strong>.

Remember to include the things you decided in previous steps, like chronology, words, phrases, emotions, or anything else you discussed.</p><p>One group member should tell a few sentences of the passage and pause. Another group member should tell the next part of the passage and pause. Do this until the group has retold the whole passage. The group members can correct each other in this step. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Next, each member of the group should tell the whole passage without interruption at least one time. A group member can use random objects, motions, or their storyboard to help them remember the passage. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Next, the group can decide whose version of the passage you like the most. You may decide that you liked the way one group member told one scene but you liked the way a different group member told another scene. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Finally, the group can put together a final version of the passage that everyone agrees on. Each group member should practice telling this final version of the passage.</p>",

Now Jude begins to talk about the reason why Jude is writing the letter.</p><p>Jude is writing to the people because Jude is very worried that some people are teaching wrong things to the followers of Jesus. Jude had first wanted to write a different letter. Jude wanted to write about how God has saved the followers of Jesus. Jude had been excited about writing such a letter. But Jude became so worried about this wrong teaching that Jude changed his mind, and now Jude writes to warn the people against these teachers who give wrong information.</p><p>Jude says that some people have joined the church who pretend to be followers of Jesus. But these people do not really obey God. These people are fake Christians, and false teachers. These people are ungodly. These people do not obey God.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: Can you tell a story about a person who pretended to be someone else? Or maybe a story about someone who gets something nice that this person later discovers is not real, but is false? Pause the audio here.</p><p>So, what is it that these people are teaching that is so bad? Let&apos;s hear it! We know that God wants to forgive people of the bad things they do, even though people do not deserve this. We call this grace. God gives grace to the people by forgiving the people of their sins. God does this because God is so kind, and God loves the people so much.</p><p>These false teachers say that because God forgives people, people can now do whatever people want to do. These teachers say that the grace of God gives people permission to sin. The teachers think that this means that people can freely do sexual sins and other things that God has forbidden, because God will forgive the people anyway.</p><p>But Jude says that the people who say this are completely wrong. It is not right to just keep sinning. Those people who say this are in fact rebelling against Jesus Christ. Those people do not accept Jesus as their Master.</p><p>Jude says that God will punish the people who give this wrong teaching. God has already said this in the Scriptures.</p><p>Jude then gives three examples where God already punished people who did wrong things. These examples are proof that God will also punish these false teachers. Jude knows that Jude&apos;s listeners already know about these examples. Jude still mentions the examples again, because the examples are so important.</p><p>Jude&apos;s first example is about the Israelites. Thousands of years earlier, the Lord had rescued the Israelites, or the descendents of Abraham, from Egypt. The Israelites had been slaves in Egypt, but God freed the Israelites and gave the Israelites a leader, Moses. Moses led the people on a long journey to the country that God had promised to give to Abraham. God did many miracles on the way to help the people survive. But the Israelites would often stop trusting God. The Israelites disobeyed God by complaining, and the Israelites did not believe that God would keep the Israelites safe. God eventually had to punish the people who did not believe God, and God killed those people.</p><p>Jude means to say that even though God had freed the Israelites from slavery, God did punish the people for their disobedience. In the same way, even though Jesus has saved the people from the punishment of sin, Jesus will punish those people if they keep sinning willfully.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: Can you tell a story about someone in your community who was punished? What was the reason for the punishment? How did the punishment affect other people? Pause this audio here.</p><p>The second example is about angels. Jude talks about some angels who disobeyed God. These angels were not satisfied to do the responsibilities that God had given the angels. These angels were not happy to stay in the place where they had to do their work. The angels left this place and the work that God had told them to do. Because of this, God has bound these angels with chains that will last forever. God keeps these angels in a place where it is very dark. On the day that God will punish all people, God will punish these angels as well.</p><p>Jude&apos;s third example is about the people from Sodom and Gomorrah. Sodom and Gomorrah were two towns in Canaan in the time of Abraham. Abraham was the ancestor of the Israelites. The people from Sodom and Gomorrah did many wrong things, and especially very bad sexual sins. God punished these people and destroyed the towns with all the people with fire from heaven. Jude says the people of Sodom and Gomorrah are similar to the disobedient angels. This might mean that these angels also had done sexual sins, or it might mean that they are similar because God punished them both.</p><p>We do not have this story about angels in the Bible. The Israelites did tell each other a story about angels who had rebelled against God and who had committed sexual sins, but that story is not in the Bible. We do not know whether this story was true or not. But because so many people knew this story, Jude uses this story as an example anyway.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: How do people in your community talk about sexual sins? Pause the audio here.</p><p>Jude says that God punished the people from Sodom and Gomorrah in order to warn other people not to sin.</p><p>Jude gives these examples of disobedient people to show that God will also punish the false teachers, and that what the false teachers are saying is wrong: we cannot just do whatever we want! God will still punish us if we willfully do wrong things, just as God has punished the people in these examples.</p><p>Jude will continue talking about these false teachers in the next part of Jude&apos;s letter.</p>\n<h2>Defining the Scenes</h2>\n<h2>Defining the Scenes</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 3–7 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.</p><p>This passage has one part. In this part, Jude warns the people in the churches about some people among them who are giving wrong teachings. In this passage, Jude uses three examples to remind the people that God will punish anyone who is disobedient.</p><p>The characters in this passage are:</p><ul><li><p>Jude</p></li><li><p>God</p></li><li><p>Jesus Christ</p></li><li><p>Godless people who are giving wrong teaching</p></li><li><p>The people of Israel</p></li><li><p>Angels who have disobeyed God</p></li><li><p>The people who lived in Sodom and Gomorrah and in the surrounding towns</p></li><li><p>And the people to whom Jude is writing</p></li></ul><p>Jude loves the people to whom Jude writes. Jude greets these people as friends. When Jude began Jude&apos;s letter, Jude said that God loved the people very much. Now Jude says that Jude himself also loves the people.</p><p>Jude had first wanted to write a letter about salvation. But then something happened and Jude changed his mind. Maybe when Jude was about to start writing Jude&apos;s letter, some people came and told Jude about this wrong teaching that was happening in some places. Jude now feels that it is extremely important to write about something else.</p><p>Jude says the people have to fight for the faith. This means that the people have to defend and protect the right teaching. The people have to work hard so that people keep believing the right things about God and Jesus, and do not start believing the wrong things. Jude encourages, or urges, the people to do this. Jude really wants the people to do this! It is very important.</p><p>You may do the following activity: Place a Bible on a table, stool, or any other place. A group of followers of Jesus stand around this Bible. Then one person tries to come inside this circle of people. This person wants to write extra things inside the Bible, or they want to tear things out from the Bible, in order to change the teaching of God. But the other people protect the Bible. Instead of using a real Bible, you can use a notebook or other object so that you do not accidentally damage the real Bible!</p><p>Stop here and do this activity.</p><p>Jude does not say that the people have to defend a <em>book</em>. But the people have to defend the right teaching. If people are teaching the wrong things, then other people should stop those people. The people should not allow people in the church to teach wrong things.</p><p>Of course, Jude does not want people to start fighting with each other, attacking each other with their fists. Jude is using the word &quot;fighting&quot; as special language to say how serious this is.</p><p>Jude says that God has entrusted this faith once and for all to the saints. This means that God has told the Christian believers what the right things are that the believers should believe. Jude calls the believers saints because the believers are holy people—the believers belong to God. The teaching that God gave the believers is the same for all times; we cannot change that teaching.</p><p>You may do the following activity: Make a row of people, with some space in between each person. The first person in the row represents God. Give this person a plate with some small objects on the plate—pebbles, leaves, buttons, or whatever! Let the person who represents God give the plate to the next person. Then that person gives the plate to the next person, and so on. Everybody should give the plate to the next person exactly as the plate was—nothing should fall off the plate or change position! Stop here and do this activity.</p><p>When you did this activity, each person had to give the plate to someone else in the same way that they received it. The person who gave you the plate gave you the responsibility that you would give the plate to the next person. Like this, God gives the believers the responsibility to pass on the same teaching to other people. The believers cannot change anything in that teaching.</p><p>Jude then says that people who are giving wrong teachings have joined the church. At first, Jude and other leaders of the church did not notice these people. This means that Jude and the other leaders did not notice that these people were giving false teachings. These false teachers pretended to be Christians, but they were not. These teachers were fake Christians.</p><p>Jude says that these false teachers—these fake Christians—do not accept Jesus as their Lord and Master. Therefore, God will punish these teachers. It is certain that this will happen, because God has already shown in the past that God will punish people who disobey God.</p><p>Jude gives three examples of how God has punished people who disobeyed God. Jude&apos;s first example is about the Israelites. Jude&apos;s second example is about angels who have disobeyed God. Jude&apos;s third example is about the people in Sodom and Gomorrah. All the people in these places were very bad. These people committed different types of sexual sins. These people did sexual things that were not normal.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: In your language, how do you talk about sexual activities that people consider wrong? What words would you use to talk about the people in Sodom and Gomorrah so that listeners will understand what you mean, without becoming embarrassed about hearing these words? Is there a way to talk about sinful sexual activities in general, without naming specific actions? Pause the audio here.</p><p>Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualise the passage and the action in it. You may want to listen once more to the recording of the Bible passage before you do this.</p>\n<h2>Embodying the Text</h2>\n<h2>Embodying the Text</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 3–7 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.</p><p>This passage has one part.</p><p>The characters in this passage are:</p><ul><li><p>Jude</p></li><li><p>God</p></li><li><p>Jesus Christ</p></li><li><p>Godless people who are giving wrong teaching</p></li><li><p>The people of Israel</p></li><li><p>Angels who have disobeyed God</p></li><li><p>The people who lived in Sodom and Gomorrah and in the surrounding towns</p></li><li><p>And the people to whom Jude is writing</p></li></ul><p>As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.</p><p>First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.</p><p>Pause this audio here and act out the passage.</p><p>The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, &quot;What are you feeling or thinking?&quot; The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.</p><p>Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.</p><p>The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.</p><p>You could first act out how some people have come among the believers who give wrong teaching. You can also act out the three examples that Jude gives.</p><p>Then, act out Jude dictating Jude&apos;s letter. The believers are listening to someone reading this letter for the believers. Even though Jude is far away from the people, it is as if Jude is talking to the people directly. You could therefore choose to have Jude speaking to the people directly, to make it easier for your drama.</p><p>Jude is speaking something like this:</p><p>&quot;My dear friends, I very much wanted to write to you about how God has saved you and us both. But then I felt it was more important to write to you about something else. I now write to beg you to do all you can to make sure that the believers have the right faith—that they keep believing the right things. God has given the responsibility for this right faith to God&apos;s holy people. But I am afraid that some people have sneaked into your community who do not belong there. These people do not care at all about what God says. These people say that people can do whatever bad things they want, because God forgives the people. But these people completely misunderstand the grace of God! And they do not accept Jesus Christ as our only Lord and Master.&quot;</p><p>Pause the drama.</p><p>Ask the actor playing Jude, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; You may hear things like: &quot;I am very worried about these false teachers! I really have to warn the people about them.&quot;</p><p>Act out Jude giving the people the three examples. Jude says something like:</p><p>&quot;I want to remind you about some things that you already know. The Lord freed his people from Egypt, but when some of those people did not trust God, God destroyed those people. And there have been some angels who were not satisfied to do the important tasks that God had given them. Those angels left the place where they had to work. God keeps these angels in a dark place of punishment. God has bound these angels with chains. These angels will stay there until God will punish them, on the great day that God will judge everyone. And remember what happened to the people in the cities Sodom and Gomorrah. These people just did whatever sexual sin they wanted to do, but God destroyed them. All these are examples of how God will punish people with a fire that will never go out.&quot;</p><p>Pause the drama.</p><p>Ask the actor playing Jude, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; People may answer things like: &quot;I hope that people will understand from these examples how serious this is. I do not want the people to disobey God like the people in these examples!&quot;</p><p>Ask the actors playing Jude&apos;s listeners, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; People may answer things like: &quot;This sounds serious. I do not want God to punish me in the way God punished the people in these examples!&quot;</p>\n<h2>Filling the Gaps</h2>\n<h2>Filling the Gaps</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 3–7 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.</p><p>Jude calls the people &quot;Jude&apos;s dear <strong>friends</strong>,&quot; or &quot;people that Jude loves.&quot;</p><p>Stop here and discuss what word or phrase you will use for <strong>friends</strong>, or people that Jude loves. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Jude had first very much wanted to write about their common <strong>salvation</strong>. God has saved the followers of Jesus from the punishment and shame for their sins. Because God had saved the people, the people have salvation. This is the same for all the followers of Jesus. Jesus&apos; followers have in common that God has saved them.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will tell what Jude first wanted to write about. Use the same word for <strong>salvation</strong> as you have used in previous passages. Look in the Master Glossary for more information about <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186588\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">salvation</span>. Pause the audio here.</p><p>Jude says the people have to fight for the <strong>faith</strong>. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186522\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">faith</span> is in the Master Glossary. Jude uses the word faith here to talk about all the things together that people have to believe about God and Jesus. This is a different way of using the word faith than we see in most other passages. The meaning here is a bit more like &quot;the right teaching,&quot; or &quot;the right things to believe in.&quot;</p><p>Jude wants the people to <strong>fight</strong> for the faith. This does not mean that Jude wants people to take up weapons and physically fight with other people. Jude wants people to do everything those people can to make sure that all of the people keep believing the right teachings. Jude says the people have to fight for this, because this is so serious. It could be that a phrase like &quot;defend the faith,&quot; or &quot;defend the right teachings,&quot; may fit better in your language.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will say that Jude wants people to &quot;fight for the faith.&quot; You can think back about the activity you did to show the idea of fighting for the faith in a previous step. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Jude says other things about the faith—or the correct things to believe—as well. Jude says that God had told the <strong>saints</strong> what were the right things to believe. The saints are the holy people. The holy people are the people who belong to God. These are the followers of Jesus.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will say in your language that God had told the <strong>saints</strong> what were the right things to believe. Use the same word for saints as you have used in other passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"222602\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">saints</span> is in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Jude says the men who were giving the wrong teaching are <strong>ungodly</strong> people. Someone who is ungodly does not care about what God says, and does not live according to God&apos;s good rules.</p><p>Stop here and discuss what word you will use for <strong>ungodly</strong> people. Use the same word as you have used in other passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"t296\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">ungodly</span> is in the Master Glossary. Pause the audio here.</p><p>These people changed the message about the <strong>grace</strong> of God. When someone shows us grace, that person gives us something good that we do not deserve. God shows grace to people when God forgives those people for their sins and makes those people God&apos;s children.</p><p>Stop here and discuss what word you will use for <strong>grace</strong>. Use the same word as you have used in other passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186536\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">grace</span> is in the Master Glossary. Pause the audio here.</p><p>The ungodly people say that because God gives grace to people, the people can do whatever the people want. These ungodly people think they can be <strong>immoral</strong>, or they think they can sin freely. The type of sin that Jude talks about is especially sexual sin.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will say this in your language. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"222622\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">immorality</span> is in the Master Glossary. Use the same word as you have used in other passages. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Jude says that these people deny our only <strong>Master</strong> and <strong>Lord</strong>, Jesus Christ. These people deny that Jesus Christ has authority over these people. The two words, Master and Lord, mean the same. They mean someone who has the highest authority over other people. Use the same word for Lord as you have used in previous passages. If your language does not have two different ways to say Master or Lord, you can decide to use only one word.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will say that Jesus Christ is the only <strong>master</strong> and <strong>lord</strong>. Do not forget to say that Jesus is the <em>only</em> master and lord. The words <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186609\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">master</span> and <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186611\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">lord</span> are in the Master Glossary. Use the same word as you have used in other passages. Pause the audio here.</p><p><strong>Christ</strong> means the special king and saviour that God has promised to send to save the people. Use the same word for Christ as you have used in other passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186574\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Christ</span> is in the Master Glossary.</p><p>The Lord freed his people, the Israelites, from Egypt, but later he destroyed the ones of them who did not <strong>believe</strong>. If you believe in someone or have faith, you believe that what that person says about himself is true. You then trust that person and are committed to do what that person tells you to do. Some of the Israelites did not believe, trust, and obey God. Therefore God destroyed those Israelites.</p><p>Stop here and discuss what word you will use for believe. Use the same word as you have used in other passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186484\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">belief</span> is in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.</p><p><strong>Angels</strong> are supernatural, spiritual beings created by God. God created angels to serve God and to sometimes give messages to people. Some angels disobeyed God. These angels became evil spirits.</p><p>Stop here and discuss what word you will use for <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186498\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">angel</span>. Use the same word as you have used in other passages. The word angel is in the Master Glossary. Pause the audio here.</p><p>God had given the angels <strong>authority</strong>, but the angels were not satisfied with this authority. If you have authority, you have the right and the power to make decisions and judgments. God had given this authority to the angels. This means that God had given the angels responsibility to do important work for God. Some angels did not want to do this work for God.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you want to say that the angels were not satisfied with the authority that God had given the angels. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186527\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">authority</span> is in the Master Glossary, but you do not need to use the word authority if there is a better way to say this.

Then listen to an audio version of Jude 8–11. Listen to this three times, in three different translations, if possible.</p><p>Pause this audio here.</p><p>Then, as a group, discuss the following questions:</p><ol><li><p>What do you like in this passage?

Then listen to an audio version of Jude 8–11 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In the previous passage, Jude warned the people about false teachers who said that it was okay to keep doing sin. These people said that we can keep doing sin, because God has so much grace that God forgives us anyway. But Jude gave some examples to show that God will punish people if they do wrong.</p><p>In this section, and in the next section, Jude is going to say many things about these false teachers. Each time, Jude tells us something new about these false teachers. Jude does not spend a lot of time explaining these things, because Jude thinks that Jude&apos;s listeners will understand.</p><p>So, let&apos;s listen to what Jude has to say about these false teachers. Jude says that these people claim that they had dreams that came from God. Because of these dreams, these people do three things: First, these people make their bodies dirty, which is Jude&apos;s way of saying that these people do sexual sin. Second, these people do not accept authority; this probably means these people do not want to obey God, though it could also mean that these people do not want to obey anyone. Third, these people say bad things about glorious beings, which are angels.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: Can you tell a story about someone who said that they had authority because of a dream they had? Or a story about something that everybody believed because one person had a dream about that thing? Pause the audio here.</p><p>We do not know what bad things these people said against angels. Jewish people had a story that the angels gave the law of God to Moses. This story is not in the Bible, but many Jewish people knew this story. These false teachers said that Christians did not have to keep the law. So maybe these false teachers said that the angels were bad because the angels gave the law to the people. It could also be that these teachers thought that they themselves were more important than the angels.</p><p>Jude then says how foolish it is of these people to say something bad about angels. To explain this, Jude gives another example from a story that is not in the Bible, but that most Jews knew. This is a story about something that happened when Moses died. In that story, the devil is arguing with Michael, who is an important leader of the angels. The devil is the leader of all evil spirits. The devil wanted to have the body of Moses. The leader of the angels, Michael, did not allow this. But Michael did not punish the devil himself, and Michael did not even say anything bad against the devil. Michael knew that God is the one who is in charge of punishment. So what Michael just said was, &quot;May the Lord punish you!&quot; Jude wants the people to know that if this important angel, Michael, did not even say anything bad against the devil, who is <em>evil</em>, these false teachers are very silly to say something bad against angels, who are <em>good</em>!</p><p>These false teachers who say bad things about angels do not know what they are talking about. The teachers think they are very spiritual because these teachers have dreams. But Jude says these teachers are not spiritual at all. In fact, these teachers behave like wild beasts. Wild beasts do not think about what they do. Wild beasts behave by instinct. Wild beasts eat, sleep, or mate whenever they want. Wild beasts do not think about these things. Wild beasts just do whatever their bodies want. For animals, this is fine. But for people, this is not fine! If people all the time just do what their bodies want them to do, people will get in trouble. These false teachers are like that. Because these teachers just do what they want, God will have to punish these teachers, and so the bad things these teachers do will destroy them.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: Can you tell a story about someone who does whatever he wants, whether it is right or wrong? Pause this audio here.</p><p>Jude says that it will end very badly for these false teachers. Jude then gives three more examples from the Old Testament. All of the people in these examples have done something bad, and Jude compares the false teachers to each of these people.</p><p>The people that Jude mentions are Cain, Balaam, and Korah. Jude mentions these people very briefly, but each of these people have stories in the Old Testament.</p><p>Cain was the first son of Adam and Eve, the first humans. Cain had a brother, Abel. Cain was jealous that God did not accept Cain&apos;s sacrifice, but that God did accept Abel&apos;s sacrifice. Cain then murdered Cain&apos;s brother, Abel.</p><p>Jude says that these false teachers are doing the same thing as Cain. Jude probably does not mean that these teachers are murderers. But Jude is again thinking of something that is not in the Bible. Jewish teachers had made a story to say that Cain, because of Cain&apos;s bad example, was teaching other people to sin. Jude probably means that these false teachers are like Cain because they are also teaching other people to sin.</p><p>The second person that Jude compares the false teachers to is Balaam. When the Israelites were on the way to the land that God had promised to give the Israelites, a king from another group of people was afraid of the Israelites. This king called a man named Balaam to curse the Israelites. This king promised to pay Balaam a lot of treasure if Balaam would curse the Israelites. But this plan failed, because God did not allow Balaam to curse the Israelites. However, Balaam then had another idea about how this king could defeat the Israelites. Balaam told the king that the women should seduce the Israelite men. The women should get the Israelite men to have sexual relations with the women and worship the women&apos;s idols with the women. Balaam probably thought that if the Israelites would do this, God would be so angry with the Israelites that God would punish the Israelites.</p><p>Unfortunately, Balaam&apos;s plan worked. The Israelites indeed sinned, and God had to punish the Israelites. But, as a result, the Israelites later killed this Balaam in a battle.</p><p>Jude compares these false teachers to Balaam, because the false teachers also are tempting people to sin, and especially to do sexual sins. And just like Balaam, these teachers are doing this in order to become rich.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: Can you tell a story about some people who lived a long time ago—a story that people still tell each other? Why are people still telling this story? Pause the audio here.</p><p>The third person that Jude compares the false teachers to is Korah. When the Israelites were on the way to the promised land, the Israelites&apos; leader was Moses. Moses was the leader because God had chosen Moses. But one time it happened that a group of people rebelled against Moses. These people said that Moses was wrong to behave as the Israelites&apos; leader. These people did not believe that God had chosen Moses. The leader of this group of people was Korah. But God then gave a special sign that God really had called Moses. And then God killed all those people who had rebelled against Moses.</p><p>Again, the Jews had extra stories about Korah that are not in the Bible. In these stories, Korah rebelled against Moses because Korah did not want to keep the law of God. And so Jude compares the false teachers to Korah, because the false teachers also do not want to keep the law of God. And just as God punished Korah, God will also punish these false teachers.</p><p>Jude has a lot more to say about these false teachers. You can feel how upset Jude is about these false teachers. We will look at these other things in the next section.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: Jude talked about Cain, Balaam, and Korah. These are all examples of people who made other people do sin. Tell a story about someone in your own community who made other people do wrong things, or who gave a bad example so that other people began to do the same.</p>\n<h2>Defining the Scenes</h2>\n<h2>Defining the Scenes</h2><p>Listen to your own translation of Jude 3–7. Then, listen to an audio version of Jude 8–11 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.</p><p>The characters in this passage are:</p><ul><li><p>Jude</p></li><li><p>False teachers</p></li><li><p>Angels</p></li><li><p>Michael, the important leader of the angels</p></li><li><p>The devil</p></li><li><p>Moses</p></li><li><p>Cain</p></li><li><p>Balaam</p></li><li><p>Korah</p></li><li><p>And the people to whom Jude is writing</p></li></ul><p>This passage has four parts.</p><p>In the first part, Jude says that the false teachers do sexual sin. These teachers do not accept God&apos;s authority. The teachers also say bad things about angels. The teachers do these things because the teachers had dreams.</p><p>In the previous passage, Jude gave examples about people who sinned and who God punished. The false teachers knew about these examples. But still these teachers kept sinning.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will make the connection between what Jude now tells us about these false teachers and the examples that Jude gave in the previous section. Pause the audio here.</p><p>In the second part, Jude gives the example of Michael. Michael was one of the most important angels. The false teachers say bad things about angels, but Michael did not even say bad things about the devil. Michael only said that God would punish the devil. This happened when Michael argued with the devil about the body of Moses after Moses died. The fact that Michael did not even say bad things about the devil shows that it is very arrogant and foolish of these false teachers to say bad things about angels!</p><p>Stop here and discuss how much you will explain about this in your translation. Pause the audio here.</p><p>In the third part, Jude compares these false teachers to wild animals who just do whatever they want. These people say bad things about angels and about the law of God. These people think that they are spiritual because they have had dreams. But these people do not really understand anything. These people behave like stupid animals. And because these people just do whatever they want, God will have to destroy these people.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will tell this part of the passage. Pause this audio here.</p><p>In the fourth part, Jude says that it will end very badly for these false teachers. Jude begins by calling out &quot;woe to them!&quot; or &quot;great sorrow to them!&quot; This means that these people are going to have a lot of sorrow and trouble. Jude says these false teachers are just like three people we know from the Old Testament: First, Jude says these teachers are like Cain, who killed Cain&apos;s brother. Second, these teachers are like Balaam, who seduced people to sin in order to become rich. And third, these teachers are like Korah, who rebelled against Moses, and who God killed because of that.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how much you will explain about these people in your translation. You can listen to the previous step again if you want to be reminded of their full stories. You may want to act out their stories. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. You may want to listen once more to the recording of the Bible passage before you do this.</p><p>You may also want to listen to your own translation of the previous passage before you do this.</p>\n<h2>Embodying the Text</h2>\n<h2>Embodying the Text</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 8–11 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.</p><p>This passage has four parts.</p><p>The characters in this passage are:</p><ul><li><p>Jude</p></li><li><p>False teachers</p></li><li><p>Angels</p></li><li><p>Michael, the important leader of the angels</p></li><li><p>The devil</p></li><li><p>Moses</p></li><li><p>Cain</p></li><li><p>Balaam</p></li><li><p>Korah</p></li><li><p>And the people to whom Jude is writing</p></li></ul><p>As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.</p><p>First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage. Do not forget to also have the people to whom Jude is writing in your drama.</p><p>Pause this audio here and act out the passage.</p><p>The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, &quot;What are you feeling or thinking?&quot; The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.</p><p>Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.</p><p>The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.</p><p>Act out the false teachers having dreams. Think of a way that you can act out that these people do sexual sins without making the group embarrassed or offended. Act out that these people do not want to accept what God tells them to do or not to do. Maybe you can have an object that symbolizes the law of God. These people could then break this object. Act out that these people speak bad things against the angels.</p><p>Pause the drama.</p><p>Ask the actors playing the teachers, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; You may hear things like: &quot;We can do anything we want! We do not have to obey the law of God.&quot;</p><p>Act out the scene that Michael argues with the devil about the body of Moses.</p><p>Pause the drama.</p><p>Ask the actor playing Michael, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; You may hear things like: &quot;The devil needs to be punished for what the devil is doing, but I will ask God to do this punishment. Only God has the authority to punish people.&quot;</p><p>Act out the false teachers doing what the teachers want to do. Maybe some people can behave like animals. Act out that God will destroy the false teachers because they do whatever their bodies want them to do.</p><p>Pause the drama.</p><p>Ask the actors playing the false teachers, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; You may hear things like: &quot;I can do whatever I want to do, whenever I want to do it!&quot; or &quot;God&apos;s law is very bad.&quot;</p><p>Act out the three little stories about Cain, Balaam, and Korah. Cain kills Cain&apos;s brother and then becomes an example for other people to do sin. Balaam seduces people to commit sexual sins and to worship false gods. Korah does not want to accept Moses&apos; authority, and is an example for people who do not want to keep God&apos;s law.</p><p>Pause the drama.</p><p>Ask the people playing Cain, Balaam, and Korah, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; You may hear things like: &quot;We do not care about the law of God. We hope that more people will break God&apos;s law.&quot;</p><p>Now, you can act out Jude telling this part of Jude&apos;s letter while other people listen. Maybe some people can use actions to remind the speaker of the different stories in Jude&apos;s speech. Jude says something like:</p><p>&quot;The ungodly people among you do sin just like these other people—like the people in Sodom and Gomorrah, like the angels who rebelled against God, and like the Israelites who did not trust God. These ungodly people say that they have had dreams. And because of these dreams, these people do sexual sins and do not accept God&apos;s authority. These people speak bad about angels. But even Michael, who is one of the most important angels, did not dare to say anything bad against the devil. This happened when Michael and the devil were arguing about what to do with the body of Moses after Moses had died. The only thing that Michael said to the devil was, &apos;I hope that the Lord will punish you!&apos; But the ungodly people among you say bad things against spiritual powers that they do not know anything about. These people behave just like stupid animals, by doing just whatever they want. These people are going to be in so much trouble! These people do the same evil things as Cain did. They do the same wrong things that Balaam did for money. And they rebel against God as Korah did. God will destroy these people just as God destroyed Korah.&quot;</p><p>Pause the drama.</p><p>Ask the actors playing the people to whom Jude is writing, &quot;What are you feeling?&quot; You may hear things like: &quot;We are afraid, because these false teachers are really bad! God will punish these teachers. If we do the same things these teachers do, God will punish us as well!&quot;</p><p>Ask the actor playing Jude, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; The person may answer things like: &quot;I have to do everything I can to warn the believers against these false teachers! I really hope that people will listen to me!&quot;</p>\n<h2>Filling the Gaps</h2>\n<h2>Filling the Gaps</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 8–11 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.</p><p>Jude calls the people who give false teaching <strong>ungodly</strong>. Someone who is ungodly does not care about what God says and does not live according to God&apos;s good rules. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"t296\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Ungodly</span> is in the Master Glossary. Use the same word as you have used in the previous passage.</p><p>These ungodly people say that they have had <strong>dreams</strong>. When you see or hear things while you sleep, you have a dream. God can use dreams to communicate to people. But in the case of these ungodly people, their dreams did not come from God. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186789\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">dream</span> is in the Master Glossary. Use the same word as you have used in other passages.</p><p>Jude says that the false teachers are <strong>polluting their bodies</strong>, or <strong>making their bodies dirty</strong>. This is Jude&apos;s way of saying that the teachers are doing sexual sins. Because these people do sexual sins, their bodies have become <strong>unclean</strong>. This means these people&apos;s bodies are unfit for the worship of God.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will describe this in your translation. It may help to listen to the explanation for the word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186615\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">unclean</span> in the Master Glossary. Pause the audio here.</p><p>The false teachers reject <strong>authority</strong>. This means the teachers do not accept that God is their boss, and the teachers do not want to listen to God. This could also mean that the teachers do not want to listen to anyone who tells the teachers what to do. Use the same word or phrase for authority that you have used in other passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186527\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">authority</span> is in the Master Glossary.</p><p>The false teachers say bad things about angels. Jude calls the angels <strong>glorious beings</strong>. Jude calls them glorious because the angels belong to heaven where God lives in all God&apos;s majesty and splendour.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will translate these <strong>glorious beings</strong>, or angels. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186498\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">angel</span> and the word for <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186553\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">glory</span> is in the Master Glossary. Pause the audio here.</p><p>Jude talks about a special angel named Michael. Michael was an <strong>archangel</strong>, which means Michael was a very important angel with special authority.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will describe this special angel. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186498\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">angel</span> is in the Master Glossary. Pause the audio here.</p><p>Michael did not even <strong>slander</strong>, or blaspheme, Satan, but the ungodly people slander against spiritual powers. To slander or blaspheme means to say bad things about someone.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will say this in your own language. Use the same word for slander, or blasphemy, as you have used in other books in the Bible. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186531\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">blasphemy</span> is in the Master Glossary. Pause the audio here.</p><p>Michael said to the devil, &quot;The <strong>Lord</strong> rebuke you!&quot; The Lord refers to God or Jesus. Lord means someone who has the highest authority over other people. Use the same word for Lord as you have used in previous passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186611\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Lord</span> is in the Master Glossary.</p><p>The <strong>devil</strong> is the leader of all evil spirits. God has created everything that exists, and therefore God also created all the spirits. God created the spirits good, as angels, to do God&apos;s work. But some angels rebelled against God, and then they became evil spirits. The most powerful of these evil spirits is called the devil, or <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186503\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Satan</span>.</p><p>Stop here and discuss what word you will use for <strong>devil</strong>. Use the same word as you have used in other books of the Bible. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186519\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">devil</span> is in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Jude calls out, or exclaims, that these people will have much sorrow. Jude says &quot;Woe to them.&quot; Woe is a word for sorrow, or misery, that people use especially when they call out like this. Jesus used the same phrase sometimes when Jesus talked about the people who were against Jesus.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will have Jude say that these people will &quot;have much sorrow.&quot; Use the same phrase as you have used in other books of the Bible.</p>\n<h2>Speaking the Word</h2>\n<h2>Speaking the Word</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of the passage in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this session, retell the passage, as a group, in your own language.</p><p>First, the whole group should practice telling the passage in your own language. Remember to include the things you decided in previous steps, like chronology, words, phrases, emotions, or anything else you discussed.</p><p>One group member should tell a few sentences of the passage and pause. Another group member should tell the next part of the passage and pause. Do this until the group has retold the whole passage. The group members can correct each other in this step. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Next, each member of the group should tell the whole passage without interruption at least one time. A group member can use random objects, motions, or their storyboard to help them remember the passage. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Next, the group can decide whose version of the passage you like the most. You may decide that you liked the way one group member told one scene but you liked the way a different group member told another scene. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Finally, the group can put together a final version of the passage that everyone agrees on. Each group member should practice telling this final version of the passage.</p>",

In Jude&apos;s time, people did not do communion, or the Lord&apos;s supper, in the way most people do this now. Today, most people have communion during a church service, and they only take a sip of the wine or juice and eat a small piece of bread. In the time of Jude, the believers often ate a meal together. As part of the meal, the believers would remember Jesus through bread and wine. Over time, they began to call such a meal a &quot;fellowship meal,&quot; or, as some translators say, a &quot;love feast.&quot; This meal was called a fellowship meal because it showed that people had a good relationship with each other and with Jesus—they were all friends with each other.</p><p>Jude says something about these false teachers and fellowship meals, but we are not sure exactly what Jude means. Some scholars think that Jude says that these false teachers, because of their behavior, are spoiling these fellowship meals. It is as if these teachers are making these meals dirty, so that the meals no longer are pleasing to God. Other scholars think that Jude says that these false teachers are like dangerous rocks in the water. When a ship is sailing on the water, it should not come close to sharp rocks. Those rocks could break the ship, and then the ship would sink. And so, maybe Jude means that these false teachers are very dangerous and will cause problems to the church. The false teachers will cause the church to break. The good fellowship that people have with God and with each other will be over.</p><p>Stop if needed and look at a picture or video of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"m901\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">sharp rocks in the water</span>. Pause the audio here.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: In your community, what special meals do people have together? What kind of relationship do you usually have with people who you eat with? Pause this audio here.</p><p>Jude then compares these teachers to bad shepherds. Jude says that these teachers are like shepherds who feed only themselves. A <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"m768\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">shepherd</span> is someone who takes care of animals like sheep or goats, and who makes sure that these animals are safe and have enough to eat. Like that, a church leader has to take care of the people in the church. The church leader has to make sure that the people have spiritual food, or that they learn more and more about God. The church leader needs to help the people to know what God wants them to do and how God wants them to behave. But these false teachers are not doing this. These teachers do not care about the people in their church. The teachers only care about themselves. The teachers are behaving as badly as a shepherd who thinks only about himself.</p><p>Jude is so upset with these false teachers that Jude keeps giving more examples to say how bad the teachers are. Jude will now use four examples from nature.</p><p>First, Jude compares these false teachers to clouds that give no rain. When it is hot and dry, people get happy when they see a cloud. People hope that the cloud will give rain. But if the cloud will just move on, drifting with the wind, without giving rain, the cloud is useless! Like that, these false teachers are useless, because the teachers should give good teaching but do not.</p><p>Then Jude compares the false teachers with fruit trees. In many countries, autumn is the time of the year when the hot summer is over but the cold of the winter has not yet begun. This is the time that fruit trees give fruit. A tree that does not give fruit in the autumn is useless. The false teachers are useless like these trees. Even worse than a tree in the autumn, these teachers are like trees that are completely dead and have been pulled out from the ground. Such a tree can never bear fruit. Like that, these false teachers can never be useful.</p><p>Then, Jude compares the false teachers to waves in the sea. These waves are wild, going here and there. These waves make a dirty foam from the water and throw this back on the land. In the same way, these false teachers do nothing but make dirt, which means they do shameful things.</p><p>Stop here and, if needed, look at a picture of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"m902\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">waves and foam</span>. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Lastly, Jude compares the false teachers to stars that have become lost and have wandered away from their place. Jude probably thinks again about a certain Jewish story that is not in the Bible. In that story, stars are like angels. And so, the stars that have wandered away are like the angels who have disobeyed God. But these stars will be punished to live forever in darkness.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: Jude compares four natural examples to these false teachers. Jude shows that these false teachers are useless and bad. If you could add one example from nature, what would it be? Stop here and discuss.</p><p>Jude is still not done talking about these false teachers. Jude now mentions Enoch, who is a person we find very early in the Old Testament. Enoch is mentioned in a list of people who lived one after another. Enoch lived seven generations after Adam and Eve. The Bible says that Enoch lived in good fellowship with God. This was very special, because most people at the time did not obey God. Enoch did not die. God took Enoch to heaven directly. This is of course very special! Because of this, the Jewish people made lots of extra stories about Enoch. By the time that Jude was writing this letter, there was even a book named after Enoch. This book was full of stories about angels and warnings that God would come to judge the people. These stories were made up by people, but people loved these stories and often told them to each other. Many of the stories that Jude refers to in Jude&apos;s letter are in this book of Enoch.</p><p>In this book about Enoch, Enoch says that the Lord God will come with a huge army of angels. God will then judge all the people in the world. God will punish everybody for the things that the people have done and said against God. The Bible does not say that Enoch really said these things, but there are many other places where the Bible does talk about God coming to judge all people. We therefore know that this is true, even if Enoch may never have said this. Jude says that when Enoch said these things a long time ago, Enoch was already talking about the false teachers.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: Tell a story from your community that may not exactly have happened, but still people tell this story and learn things from it. Pause the audio here.</p><p>So Jude means that God will punish the false teachers because those teachers have done ungodly deeds. If someone disobeys God and does not care about what God might think about that disobedience, this person is doing ungodly deeds. God will also punish them because of the things these false teachers have said against God. They have said very proud things against God that were terrible to hear.</p><p>Now Jude says Jude&apos;s final things about these false teachers. Jude says that they are people who are always complaining. The teachers are probably complaining because they do not want to keep the law of God. Also, they are always saying that what other people say about these matters is wrong. Jude says these people want to do whatever they want. These people are very arrogant when they speak. Instead of listening to God, these people pretend to be more important than God.</p><p>The last thing that Jude says about these teachers is that these people are saying things that other people like to hear. They do not teach true things, but the teachers just say things that will make people happy. So, if someone has sinned, these teachers will not tell that person that he is wrong. The teachers will say that the person can keep sinning. The teachers do this so that the people will like these teachers and will give the teachers gifts or do other good things for them.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: Can you tell a story about people who say nice things to other people that are not true, because these people want other people to like them and to do something for them?</p>\n<h2>Defining the Scenes</h2>\n<h2>Defining the Scenes</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 12–16 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.</p><p>The characters in this passage are:</p><ul><li><p>Jude</p></li><li><p>False teachers</p></li><li><p>Enoch</p></li><li><p>Adam</p></li><li><p>The Lord, which can mean God, or Jesus</p></li><li><p>And the people to whom Jude is writing</p></li></ul><p>This passage has four parts.</p><p>In the first part, Jude says that these false teachers are not even ashamed about the bad things that the teachers are doing. The teachers are spoiling the fellowship meals that the believers have with their shameless behavior.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: This part has two possible meanings. It can mean that the false teachers are like a dirty spot. The teachers spoil the fellowship meals. The teachers make the fellowship meals unacceptable before God. Or, it could mean that the false teachers are like dangerous rocks under water. The teachers will break up the good fellowship that the believers have with each other and with God. The translation that you are listening to has chosen one of these two meanings. Discuss whether you will do the same, or whether you want to choose the other meaning. Pause the audio here.</p><p>In the second part of the passage, Jude compares these false teachers to four things we can find in nature: clouds that give no rain, fruit trees that bear no fruit, waves in the sea that make a dirty foam, and stars.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: You may want to make a storyboard or use objects or actions to remember these four things before you continue. Pause the audio here.</p><p>Stop here: You may want to visualize the first and the second part together before you continue. Pause the audio here.</p><p>In the third part, Jude begins to talk about Enoch. Jude says that Enoch was the seventh descendant from Adam. This means that Adam had a son, that son had a son, and so on, until Enoch was born. In the book of Genesis, we see that Enoch lived six generations after Adam, not seven. But Jude also counts Adam in the number in order to make seven generations. Jude probably does this because the number seven is always important in the Bible, and so this shows even more how special Enoch was. Jude says that Enoch spoke about what was going to happen in the future. Enoch said that the Lord God would come, together with a great crowd of angels. The Lord would then judge all the people, and punish bad people for the bad things that those people have done.</p><p>Jude uses the word ungodly here four times to show how very far away from God these people are. Jude says that:</p><ul><li><p>God will judge the ungodly people;</p></li><li><p>God will punish these people because of the ungodly things they have done;</p></li><li><p>these people have done these things in an ungodly way;</p></li><li><p>and these ungodly sinners have spoken insulting and offending words to God.</p></li></ul><p>When Jude says that the people have done ungodly things in an ungodly way, Jude means to say that these people have been extremely ungodly.</p><p>Stop here and do this activity: Measure out a line of people from Adam, the very first person, to Adam&apos;s descendant Enoch. Act out that Enoch says the Lord will come with thousands of holy angels in order to judge the ungodly people. Maybe people can clap or make some other sound every time they hear the word &quot;ungodly.&quot; Or, instead of this, make a storyboard or do another type of visualization for this part of the passage. Pause the audio here.</p><p>In the fourth part of the passage, Jude says that these false teachers always complain and criticize other people. The teachers do whatever bad thing the teachers want to do. The teachers speak very arrogantly and say things just in order to please people, so that they themselves will get something nice in return.</p><p>Stop here and think of a gesture or an action that you can do for each of the things that the false teachers do in this part. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the whole passage.</p>\n<h2>Embodying the Text</h2>\n<h2>Embodying the Text</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 12–16 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.</p><p>This passage has four parts.</p><p>The characters in this passage are:</p><ul><li><p>Jude</p></li><li><p>False teachers</p></li><li><p>Enoch</p></li><li><p>Adam</p></li><li><p>The Lord</p></li><li><p>And the people to whom Jude is writing</p></li></ul><p>As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language. Do not forget to include the people to whom Jude is writing.</p><p>First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.</p><p>Pause this audio here and act out the passage.</p><p>The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, &quot;What are you feeling or thinking?&quot; The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.</p><p>Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.</p><p>The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.</p><p>Act out how the believers have a fellowship meal together.</p><p>Act out how the false teachers are present at the meal.</p><p>Act out how Jude tells the people that the false teachers are spoiling the fellowship meals.</p><p>Choose the meaning that you decided in the previous step.</p><p>Act out Jude as Jude first compares the false teachers to shepherds who only feed themselves, and then to the four examples from nature.</p><p>Pause the drama.</p><p>Ask the person playing Jude, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; The person may answer things like: &quot;I need to think of lots of examples so that the people will really understand how bad these false teachers are!&quot;</p><p>Act out Jude as Jude gives his example from Enoch.</p><p>Pause the drama.</p><p>Ask the person playing Jude, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; People may answer things like: &quot;I know that the people like to listen to the stories about Enoch. Even though these stories are not in the Bible, I can use these stories to make people understand how bad these false teachers are.&quot;</p><p>Start again and act out Jude telling this whole part. The rest of the group should act out the people that are listening to Jude. First, Jude says something like this:</p><p>&quot;These false teachers behave very badly, and they have no shame at all. Because of these teachers&apos; behavior, they are making your fellowship meals unacceptable before God.&quot; Or Jude might say it this way: &quot;Because of these false teachers&apos; bad behavior, they are very dangerous. These teachers will break up the good relationship that you have with each other and with God.&quot;</p><p>Next, Jude says:</p><p>&quot;These people care only about themselves. These people are like clouds that drift away along the wind without giving refreshing rain. These people are like trees that do not give fruit in the right season, and that are pulled out from the ground—as dead as can be! These people are like wild waves of the sea, beyond control, doing shameful things. These people are like stars that left their proper place; but like such stars, God will punish them and make them live forever in darkness.</p><p>&quot;Enoch, who lived seven generations after Adam, already knew that such people would come, and Enoch told us that God would punish these people. Because Enoch said, &apos;See, the Lord will come with a great army of his holy angels, and he will judge everybody. The Lord will punish the bad people for the bad things that they have done and for the bad things they have said against God.&apos;</p><p>&quot;These people are always complaining about having to do the things that God wants, and these people say that the people who do not agree with them are wrong. These people just do whatever bad things they want to do. And these people teach the people whatever the people like to hear, even if it is not true. These people do this because they want to get rich.&quot;</p><p>Pause the drama.</p><p>Ask the actors playing the listeners, &quot;What are you feeling?&quot; You may hear things like: &quot;These false teachers are really bad. We should not listen to these teachers. We are so glad that Jude is warning us!&quot;</p>\n<h2>Filling the Gaps</h2>\n<h2>Filling the Gaps</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 12–16 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.</p><p>A <strong>fellowship meal</strong>, or <strong>love feast</strong>, was a meal where believers came together to eat food, and where the believers also remembered Jesus by drinking wine and eating bread. The believers did this because, when Jesus ate his last meal with Jesus&apos; disciples before he was arrested, Jesus had divided bread into pieces and gave this to Jesus&apos; disciples. Then Jesus had said to his disciples, &quot;This bread represents my body—eat it.&quot; And Jesus had given his disciples wine and said, &quot;This represents my blood—drink it.&quot; And Jesus had also said to his disciples, &quot;Keep doing this so that you will remember me.&quot; Therefore, after Jesus had gone back to heaven, Jesus&apos; followers kept a special moment during their meals when they remembered Jesus through bread and wine. The meals where they did this together with other believers they called &quot;fellowship meals.&quot;</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will say &quot;fellowship meal&quot; in your translation. Listen to the definition of <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"t50\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">fellowship</span> in the Master Glossary, if needed. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Jude says that these teachers are like <strong>shepherds</strong> who feed only themselves. A shepherd is someone who takes care of animals like sheep or goats, and who makes sure that these animals are safe and have enough to eat. Like that, a church leader has to take care of the people in the church. The church leader has to make sure that the people have spiritual food—that they learn more and more about God.</p><p>Stop here and, if needed, look at a picture of a shepherd. Discuss as a team what word or phrase you will use for <strong>shepherds</strong>. Use the same word as you have used in other books you have translated. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186573\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Shepherd</span> is in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Jude compares the false teachers to <strong>waves</strong> that throw back <strong>foam</strong> on the land. Foam is a very thin layer of white bubbles that can remain for a short time on the land after a wave from the sea has washed over the land.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will describe this in your language. If needed, watch the photo or video of a <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"m902\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">wave</span> again. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Jude said that Enoch <strong>prophesied</strong> about what would happen to these false teachers. If you say that something is going to happen in the future, you prophesy. Enoch knew what was going to happen with these false teachers because God had told Enoch.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will say that Enoch <strong>prophesied</strong>. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"t247\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">prophesy</span> is in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.</p><p>According to Jude, Enoch had said &quot;the <strong>Lord</strong> is coming.&quot; The Lord refers to God or to Jesus. A Lord means someone who has the highest authority over other people. Use the same word for Lord as you have used in previous passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186611\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Lord</span> is in the Master Glossary.</p><p>Enoch had said, &quot;The Lord is coming with <strong>thousands upon thousands</strong> of <strong>holy ones</strong>.&quot; Thousands upon thousands means a great many. Holy ones probably means <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186498\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">angels</span>. Angels are holy because they belong to God. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186506\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">holy</span> is in the Master Glossary. Use the same word as you have used in previous passages.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will say &quot;a great many of holy ones,&quot; or &quot;a great many of holy angels.&quot; Pause this audio here.</p><p>When the Lord comes, the Lord will <strong>judge</strong> everyone. To judge means to decide whether a person is guilty or not. The Lord will then <strong>convict</strong> everyone of their ungodly deeds. When someone convicts a person, he says that person is guilty and needs to be punished.</p><p>Stop here and discuss what words you will use for these terms. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"222615\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">convict</span> is in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.</p><p>God will convict the people for their <strong>ungodly</strong> deeds or works. When people willfully disobey God, and when people do things that make God sad and they do not repent or feel ashamed about this, then those people do ungodly acts. Translate ungodly in the same way you have in previous passages. <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"t296\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Ungodly</span> is in the Master Glossary.</p><p>God will also convict the ungodly <strong>sinners</strong> because of their <strong>proud words</strong>. Some translations say the false teachers are speaking &quot;hard words.&quot; Jude means to say that these people are saying things against God that are awful. God would be deeply offended by the things that these people say.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will say that these people have spoken proud, hard, or terrible words against God. Pause this audio here.</p><p><strong>Sinners</strong> are people who commit sin. Sin is an act of rebellion against God. Anytime that a person disobeys God&apos;s laws, that person sins.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will talk about people who are doing <strong>sin</strong>. Use the same word for sin as you have used in other passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186477\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">sin</span> is in the Master Glossary.</p>\n<h2>Speaking the Word</h2>\n<h2>Speaking the Word</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of the passage in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this session, retell the passage, as a group, in your own language.</p><p>First, the whole group should practice telling the passage in your own language.

    "content": "<h2>Hear and Heart</h2>\n<h2>Hear and Heart</h2><p>In this step, hear Jude 17–23 and put it in your hearts.</p><p>First, listen to your own translation of all the passages from Jude, one after another. Then listen to audio versions of Jude 17–23. Listen to these three times, in three different translations, if possible.</p><p>Pause this audio here.</p><p>Then, as a group, discuss the following questions:</p><ol><li><p>What do you like in this passage? Pause this audio here.</p></li><li><p>What do you not like or not understand in this passage? Pause this audio here.</p></li><li><p>What does this passage tell us about God, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit? Pause this audio here.</p></li><li><p>What does this passage tell us about people? Pause this audio here.</p></li><li><p>How does this passage affect our daily lives? Pause this audio here.</p></li><li><p>Who do you know who needs to hear this passage?</p></li></ol>\n<h2>Setting the Stage</h2>\n<h2>Setting the Stage</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 17–23 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>So far, Jude has been telling his listeners how dangerous the people are who say that you can keep on sinning. Jude also said God will punish these people. Now Jude will tell Jude&apos;s listeners what they should do.</p><p>First, Jude tells Jude&apos;s listeners that they have to remember what the apostles have said. An apostle is someone who received a special authority from Jesus to speak on Jesus&apos; behalf. The apostles are people like Peter, John, James, and others. These people had known Jesus very well when Jesus was still on earth. Therefore, these apostles were important people to listen to. And these apostles had already warned the other believers that there would be people who would mock the Lord and the believers. Those people would say things to make the other people look ridiculous. This is what the false teachers are doing. The false teachers mock God&apos;s good rules by saying bad things about these rules. The teachers say they do not need these rules—they can do whatever they like. The false teachers make God and God&apos;s good rules look ridiculous. The teachers also make people who follow God&apos;s good rules look ridiculous.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: Can you tell a story about someone who said things to make another person look ridiculous? Pause this audio here.</p><p>The apostles had said that this would happen in the &quot;last days,&quot; or in the &quot;end times.&quot; When Jesus will come back and establish Jesus&apos; kingdom forever, a new time will begin. In the New Testament, the whole time between Jesus&apos; resurrection and the time that Jesus will come back is called the &quot;last days.&quot; So, Jude and Jude&apos;s listeners were living in the &quot;last days,&quot; but so are we.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: Can you tell a story about something that the people in your community think is going to happen in the future? Pause this audio here.</p><p>So, the apostles had said that some people would come and mock the Lord and do whatever those people wanted to do. And this is exactly what those false teachers now are doing!</p><p>The people to whom Jude is writing should be very different from these fake Christians. Jude reminds the people that they should help each other to keep believing the right things. Jude also says that the people should patiently wait for the time that the Lord Jesus will come back. When Jesus will come back, a new time will begin, and the believers will then live forever in good relationship with God. This will be possible because Jesus has so much mercy, or love and compassion, for the believers.</p><p>Jude then says that the believers should be kind to the people who are confused by the false teachers and who do not know what to believe. And if people have already started to believe the false teachers, then the believers should do their best to save these people. The believers should also be a bit scared so that the believers themselves will not start to do the same wrong things.</p><p>Stop here and do this activity as a group, if you like: Go outside and find something that is really dirty. Then clean that thing together with your bare hands. Are you able to keep yourselves clean, or do you become dirty as well? Pause this audio here.</p><p>When you did this activity, you yourselves probably became dirty as well. Jude is warning the people that if they teach other people to do the right things, they have to be careful not to become &quot;dirty&quot; themselves. The people might start doing the same wrong things as the other people if they are not careful!</p>\n<h2>Defining the Scenes</h2>\n<h2>Defining the Scenes</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 17–23 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.</p><p>This passage has one part.</p><p>The characters in this passage are:</p><ul><li><p>Jude</p></li><li><p>The apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ</p></li><li><p>Godless people who are giving wrong teaching</p></li><li><p>The people to whom Jude is writing</p></li><li><p>People who are not sure what to believe</p></li><li><p>People who have believed the teaching of the false teachers</p></li><li><p>The Holy Spirit</p></li><li><p>And God</p></li></ul><p>Jude begins this section by telling the believers what the believers should do. The way Jude begins makes clear that Jude is going to say something very important. The false teachers are doing wrong things, but the believers should remember what the apostles of Jesus had said. Jude is stressing that the believers are Jude&apos;s friends—that Jude loves the believers. Jude hopes that this will make the believers really listen to Jude.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you can begin this passage. Pause this audio here.</p><p>The apostles had said that in the end of our time there would be people who mock the Lord and do just whatever they want. In the New Testament, the end of times means the whole period between Jesus&apos; resurrection and Jesus&apos; return. So all of us, Jude and Jude&apos;s listeners as well as you and me, are living at the end of time. This time is called the end of times, or the last times, because there is only one more big thing that God is going to do to save us, and that is that Jesus will come back and begin to rule forever!</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will talk about the end of time in your language. Pause this audio here.</p><p>The apostles had said that there would be people who will &quot;mock,&quot; or scoff. People who mock, or scoff, are looking down on someone. Then these people say things to make the other person look ridiculous. This is what the false teachers are doing. The false teachers mock God&apos;s good rules by saying bad things about these rules. The teachers say they do not need these rules. The teachers can do whatever they like. These teachers make God and God&apos;s good rules look ridiculous. The teachers also make people who follow God&apos;s good rules look ridiculous.</p><p>The apostles had said that these mockers did just do whatever they wanted. The mockers&apos; own ungodly desires led them. Something that is ungodly is against God&apos;s will.</p><p>Stop here and do this activity: Take a plate of good food, or a nice piece of clothing, or any object that is something that people like to have. Make a row of people. One person holds the object. This person walks around and the other people follow the person with the object. The people who follow the person with the object want to have this object. Pause this audio here and do this activity.</p><p>When you did this activity, you followed the thing that you wanted to have. The thing you wanted was leading you where to go. This is what Jude meant when Jude said that people are led by their own desires. The thing that the people want is in fact the boss of the people!</p><p>Now, Jude says the things that these people want are ungodly. So, the things that these people want to do are against God&apos;s will.</p><p>Jude says a few more things about the fake Christians. These people cause conflicts in the church. These people just do whatever they want. These people do not let the Holy Spirit of God control them.</p><p>Stop here and do this activity: Make the same row of people as you did for the previous activity, with one person in front who is holding an object that people like. But now, have another person stand in the room who represents the Holy Spirit. Maybe this person can hold the Bible, or some other object that helps you to remember that this person represents the Holy Spirit. Now, both the person who is holding the object that people like, and the person who represents the Holy Spirit, will walk through the room. Everybody else gets to choose: Will they follow the Holy Spirit, or will they follow the thing that they want to have? Pause this audio here and do this activity.</p><p>In this activity, some people followed the Holy Spirit, and some people followed the things that those people wanted to have. Jude says that the fake Christians are like the people who follow the things those people want. The fake Christians do not follow the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Jude then says that the believers should be very different from these people. Jude calls Jude&apos;s listeners &quot;dear friends.&quot; Jude has warned Jude&apos;s listeners about the fake Christians, and now Jude speaks to Jude&apos;s listeners in a very friendly and encouraging way.</p><p>Jude says that the believers should build themselves up on their most holy faith. Earlier in Jude&apos;s letter, Jude had said that people should fight for the faith. We learned that fighting for the faith means that the people have to defend and protect the right teaching. Now, Jude says that this holy faith, this right teaching, is like the foundation of a building. Jude is using special language here. If people build a building on a good foundation, the building will be strong. And so, if the believers will keep believing the right thing, then together the believers will be strong. The believers will be united and will keep growing spiritually.</p><p>Jude says that the believers should pray in the Holy Spirit. This means that the believers should let the Holy Spirit guide the believers in what to pray for and how to pray.</p><p>The believers should always remember that God loves the believers, and do the things that God loves. And all the time, the believers are waiting for Jesus to be so good to them that Jesus will give the believers to live forever with God.</p><p>Jude then says something about how the believers should treat other people. Jude is probably thinking about people in the church who have listened to the false teachers.</p><p>Some people have listened to the false teachers and those people have become confused. Those people do not know anymore what to believe. The believers should be very kind to those people, and the believers should help those people to believe the right thing.</p><p>Some people may have listened to the false teachers, and these people believed what these false teachers said. These people are in a very dangerous position. It is almost too late to save them. It is as if these people are in a fire that will soon burn these people up. And so, the other believers have to be very quick! The other believers should talk to these people and help them to see that they are believing the wrong things, before it is too late. Maybe these people can still be saved!</p><p>There are also other people who have believed what the false teachers have said. These people started to do the same sin as the false teachers: They also do just whatever bad thing they want, and they no longer obey God. Everybody can see that these people are doing the wrong things, just as anyone can see it when a person has dirty clothes. If someone is wearing very dirty and smelly clothes, then other people do not want to be close to that person. Like that, the believers should not want to be very close with people who are doing these wrong things. The believers should still be kind to those people, but at the same time they should be afraid of those people. The believers should be very cautious that they themselves will not start doing the same wrong things. The believers should even hate the bad things that these people are doing.</p><p>Stop here and do this activity: Act out how the believers should respond to these three different groups of people. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. You may want to listen once more to the recording of the Bible passage before you do this.</p>\n<h2>Embodying the Text</h2>\n<h2>Embodying the Text</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 17–23 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.</p><p>This passage has one part.</p><p>The characters in this passage are:</p><ul><li><p>Jude</p></li><li><p>The apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ</p></li><li><p>Godless people who are giving wrong teaching</p></li><li><p>The people to whom Jude is writing</p></li><li><p>People who are not sure what to believe</p></li><li><p>People who have believed the teaching of the false teachers</p></li><li><p>The Holy Spirit</p></li><li><p>And God</p></li></ul><p>As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.</p><p>First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.</p><p>Pause this audio here and act out the passage.</p><p>The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, &quot;What are you feeling or thinking?&quot; The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.</p><p>Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.</p><p>The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.</p><p>Jude says something like: &quot;Dear friends, you should not be like these fake Christians. You should remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ have already said some time ago. The apostles said that at the end of our time there would be people who would mock the Lord. These people would do whatever bad thing they want.</p><p>&quot;And you see that these people have indeed come. And these people cause conflicts, and make it so that there are different groups in the church who are against each other. These people do not do what the Holy Spirit wants, but what they themselves want.&quot;</p><p>Pause the drama.</p><p>Ask the people listening to Jude, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; People may say things like:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;It is true that we now have conflicts in the church. We did not know that these people were not real Christians!&quot; or</p></li><li><p>&quot;We can see that this is very important to Jude. Jude really wants us to pay attention!&quot;</p></li></ul><p>Jude continues speaking: &quot;Dear friends, you should be different. You should believe the right things, the holy things from God. Then together you will become strong. You should pray the things that the Holy Spirit tells you to pray. Remember that God loves you, and do the things that God loves. And wait for Jesus who will be so kind to you and will let you live forever with him.&quot;</p><p>Pause the drama.</p><p>Ask the people listening to Jude, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; People may say things like:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;We feel bad that we have listened to these fake Christians;&quot; or</p></li><li><p>&quot;We should do the things that God loves. That means that we should not behave so badly as these people do.&quot;</p></li></ul><p>Jude continues speaking: &quot;Be kind to the people who are not sure what to believe. Try to save people who are doing the wrong things. Be careful with people who willfully continue to do the wrong thing. You should still be kind to these people, but you also should be careful that these people will not end up making you do wrong things. You should hate the bad things that these people are doing.&quot;</p><p>Pause the drama.</p><p>Ask the people listening to Jude, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; People may say things like:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;I am worried about some people in our church. These people believe that what these fake Christians are saying is true. I should talk to these people and make sure that they will believe the right things!&quot; or</p></li><li><p>&quot;Some people are doing very bad things, and these people tell other people to do the same things. I think I better stay away from these people. Otherwise, I also may start doing the wrong things!&quot;</p></li></ul><p>Ask the person playing Jude, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; The person may say something like:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;I really hope that the believers will be very careful. The believers should not listen to the false teachers. I hope so much that the believers will all keep believing and doing the right things!&quot;</p></li></ul>\n<h2>Filling the Gaps</h2>\n<h2>Filling the Gaps</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 17–23 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.</p><p>Jude calls his listeners &quot;dear friends,&quot; or &quot;beloved people.&quot; This is the same phrase Jude used in the beginning of Jude&apos;s letter. Use the same phrase as you have used there.</p><p><strong>Apostles</strong> are people who have received a special authority from Jesus to speak on Jesus&apos; behalf. Jesus&apos; 12 disciples became apostles, but so did some of Jesus&apos; brothers, like James and Jude. Paul is another one of the apostles. God had given the apostles the authority to teach and to make decisions about spiritual matters. The apostles were the representatives of Jesus in the church.</p><p>Stop here and discuss what word or phrase you will use for <strong>apostles</strong>. Use the same word as you have used in other books you already translated. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186601\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">apostle</span> is in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.</p><p>The apostles are the apostles of our <strong>Lord</strong> Jesus Christ. Lord means someone who has the highest authority over other people. Use the same word for Lord as you have used in previous passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186611\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Lord</span> is in the Master Glossary.</p><p><strong>Christ</strong> is the same as Messiah, the special king and Savior that God had promised to send. Use the same word as you have used in other passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186574\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Christ</span> is in the Master Glossary.</p><p>The fake Christians do whatever <strong>ungodly</strong> thing they want to do. Something that is ungodly is not according to what God wants. Use the same word as you have used in the previous passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"t296\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">ungodly</span> is in the Master Glossary.</p><p>Jude says that these people do not have the <strong>Spirit</strong>. &quot;The Spirit&quot; means the Spirit of God. The Bible also calls this the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the power that comes from God. The Holy Spirit makes it possible for people to become followers of Jesus. When people start to follow Jesus, the Holy Spirit works in these people&apos;s hearts to help them to behave more and more like Jesus.</p><p>Later on, Jude will say that the believers should <strong>pray in the Holy Spirit</strong>. That means the believers should pray what the Holy Spirit makes the believers to pray. The first time Jude mentioned the Holy Spirit, he just said &quot;spirit.&quot; The second time Jude said &quot;Holy Spirit.&quot; Jude is talking about the same spirit both times.</p><p>Stop here and discuss what word you will use for <strong>spirit</strong> and for <strong>Holy Spirit</strong>. Do you need to say Holy Spirit both times, or can you first say Spirit and the second time say Holy Spirit? How can you translate this so that people realise these words are the same thing? The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186642\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Holy Spirit</span> is in the Master Glossary. Use the same word for Holy Spirit as you have used in other books. Pause this audio here.</p><p>The believers have to build themselves up in the holy <strong>faith</strong>. When someone talks about &quot;the faith,&quot; they talk about all the things together that people have to believe about God and Jesus.</p><p>Use the same word for faith as you have used in the previous passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186522\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">faith</span> is in the Master Glossary.</p><p>This faith is <strong>holy</strong>, because God is the one who gives this faith. Use the same word for holy as you have used in previous passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186506\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">holy</span> is in the Master Glossary.</p><p>The believers should <strong>pray</strong> in the Holy Spirit. That means the believers should pray what the Holy Spirit wants the believers to pray. When people speak with God, these people are praying. People can praise God, thank God, ask God for help, tell God about something wrong they have done, ask God to help other people, or just cry to God because they feel so sad. In the Bible, all these things are part of praying.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will say that people should <strong>pray in the Holy Spirit</strong>. Use the same word or phrase for praying as you have used in other passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186597\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">pray</span> is in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.</p><p>The believers should look forward to the Lord Jesus Christ who will give them <strong>mercy</strong>. The word mercy means goodness, kindness, or compassion. Jesus will give mercy to the believers when Jesus will forgive the believers&apos; sins and let the believers live forever with Jesus. The believers should show mercy to other people when they are not sure what to believe. This means that believers should be kind to these people. Use the same word for mercy as you have used in previous passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186537\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">mercy</span> is in the Master Glossary.</p>\n<h2>Speaking the Word</h2>\n<h2>Speaking the Word</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of the passage in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this session, retell the passage, as a group, in your own language.</p><p>First, the whole group should practice telling the passage in your own language. Remember to include the things you decided in previous steps, like chronology, words, phrases, emotions, or anything else you discussed.</p><p>One group member should tell a few sentences of the passage and pause. Another group member should tell the next part of the passage and pause. Do this until the group has retold the whole passage. The group members can correct each other in this step. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Next, each member of the group should tell the whole passage without interruption at least one time. A group member can use random objects, motions, or their storyboard to help them remember the passage. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Next, the group can decide whose version of the passage you like the most. You may decide that you liked the way one group member told one scene but you liked the way a different group member told another scene. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Finally, the group can put together a final version of the passage that everyone agrees on. Each group member should practice telling this final version of the passage.</p>",

    "content": "<h2>Hear and Heart</h2>\n<h2>Hear and Heart</h2><p>In this step, hear Jude 24–25 and put it in your hearts.</p><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 24–25. Listen to this three times, in three different translations, if possible.</p><p>Pause this audio here.</p><p>Then, as a group, discuss the following questions:</p><ol><li><p>What do you like in this passage? Pause this audio here.</p></li><li><p>What do you not like or not understand in this passage? Pause this audio here.</p></li><li><p>What does this passage tell us about God, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit? Pause this audio here.</p></li><li><p>What does this passage tell us about people? Pause this audio here.</p></li><li><p>How does this passage affect our daily lives? Pause this audio here.</p></li><li><p>Who do you know who needs to hear this passage?</p></li></ol>\n<h2>Setting the Stage</h2>\n<h2>Setting the Stage</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of June 24–25 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>Jude is now finishing Jude&apos;s letter. Jude has given Jude&apos;s warning about the false teachers and has told the believers what to do. Now Jude closes with a praise song to God.</p><p>In Jude&apos;s small song, Jude says many things about God and about Jesus.</p><p>Jude says that God can make sure that the believers do not fall. This means that God can make sure that the believers will not follow the false teachers and do the same sins that the false teachers do. Jude uses the special language of &quot;falling&quot; for this.</p><p>Stop here and do this activity: Find something narrow that people can walk over. Maybe a tree that has fallen down, or a narrow plank, or you can make a path of rocks. It should be a little bit difficult for people to walk over this, but not impossible. Then, take turns walking over this. The other people stand around and help the person who is balancing not to fall down. Pause this audio here.</p><p>When you did this activity, maybe some people fell off the path that you had made. In Jude&apos;s letter, people who follow the false teaching are like people who fall off the right path. And God is like the people who are helping the others not to fall. God helps people to do the right thing.</p><p>Jude also says that God can make sure that the believers will stand before God in all God&apos;s majesty and splendor. Jude is using special language here as well. To stand before God means to be accepted by God. If you stand before the glorious presence of God, it is as if you are standing in the room where God sits on God&apos;s throne to rule as king.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: Talk about the most important or powerful leader in your community or country. What kind of people can visit this person? If you would want to visit this person, what would you have to do? Pause this audio here.</p><p>No one who is sinful can stand before God&apos;s throne. God does not accept anyone who is sinful. But God can make the sin of the people go away. God can make the believers perfect. God does this because Jesus Christ has saved these people. And so, the people <em>can</em> stand before God. And when the people are accepted by God, the people will be so joyful!</p><p>Stop here and discuss: Can you tell a story about the happiest moment in your life? How did you feel? Pause this audio here.</p><p>Jude praises God because God has saved the people. God saved the people because God let God&apos;s son Jesus die for the people, and God also made Jesus alive again. All glory, majesty, power, and authority belong to God. God is the only one who has all the glory: God is the only one that people should praise. God is the only one who has all majesty: God is the only one that people should accept as king. God is the only one who has all power and authority. God is the one who decides what happens in the world, and everybody has to listen to God.</p><p>Stop here and discuss: Can you tell a story about someone praising someone in authority? In your community, how do you praise important people?</p>\n<h2>Defining the Scenes</h2>\n<h2>Defining the Scenes</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 24–25 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.</p><p>This passage has one part.</p><p>The characters in this passage are:</p><ul><li><p>Jude</p></li><li><p>The people to whom Jude is writing</p></li><li><p>God</p></li><li><p>And the Lord Jesus Christ</p></li></ul><p>Jude begins this part in a way that makes clear that Jude is going to say something differently from before. Jude has finished talking about the false teachers and about what the believers should do. Jude is now going to praise God.</p><p>Jude calls God, &quot;The one who can keep you from falling.&quot; Later, Jude calls God &quot;the only God, our Savior.&quot;</p><p>Jude uses the actions of falling and standing. God can make sure that people &quot;do not fall.&quot; That means that people will not begin to do sin. God can also make sure that people &quot;stand before his glorious presence.&quot; If people can stand before God&apos;s glorious presence, it means that God has accepted those people.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will say that God can keep the people from falling, and can make those people stand. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Stop here and do this activity: Think of your space as the room where God sits on God&apos;s throne to rule. On one end of the room, make a throne, or special chair where a king sits, and let someone who represents God sit on the throne. All the other people stand on the other side of the room. Use chalk or objects to make a narrow path to the throne. Make someone who represents Jesus stand next to the path. The believers now cross the path one by one. Jesus holds each believers&apos; hand. Everybody who holds Jesus&apos; hand is able to cross safely and come to the throne. When everybody is before the throne, you can act out that God says that everybody is now perfect, without sin! And this is because Jesus has saved them! Then, act out a wonderful party of celebration! Express your joy by dancing or jumping or clapping or singing! Pause this audio here.</p><p>This part of Jude&apos;s letter is like a praise song to God. Can you sing this passage?</p><p>Pause this audio here and make a song!</p>\n<h2>Embodying the Text</h2>\n<h2>Embodying the Text</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 24–25 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.</p><p>This passage has one part.</p><p>The characters in this passage are:</p><ul><li><p>Jude</p></li><li><p>The people to whom Jude is writing</p></li><li><p>God</p></li><li><p>And the Lord Jesus Christ</p></li></ul><p>As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.</p><p>First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.</p><p>Pause this audio here and act out the passage.</p><p>The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, &quot;What are you feeling or thinking?&quot; The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.</p><p>Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.</p><p>The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.</p><p>Jude says something like: &quot;Let us praise God together now. God can keep you safe so that you will not make a mistake and do sin. God can bring you into God&apos;s wonderful throne room, where God is in all God&apos;s majesty and splendor. God can make you perfect. God will completely accept you. You will sing and dance with joy then!&quot;</p><p>Pause the drama.</p><p>Ask the people playing Jude&apos;s listeners, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; People may answer things like:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;I am so glad that God can make me perfect! I find it so difficult not to do sin. But God has saved me already!&quot; or</p></li><li><p>&quot;This is very exciting news! How happy we will all be when we stand together before God!&quot;</p></li></ul><p>Jude continues speaking something like this: &quot;Let us praise our only God, who has saved us through Jesus Christ our Lord. God is the only one who deserves all our praise. God is the only one who is King. And God is the only one who has all power and authority. Not just today, but from the beginning, and till forever. Amen!&quot;</p><p>Pause the drama.</p><p>Ask the person playing Jude, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; The person may answer things like:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;God is so wonderful! And I trust that God will help the believers to do the right thing. If the believers trust God, God will help them!&quot; or</p></li><li><p>&quot;I hope that the people have really understood my message, and that the people will stop the fake Christians from teaching the wrong things!&quot;</p></li></ul><p>Ask the people playing Jude&apos;s listeners, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; People may answer things like:</p><ul><li><p>&quot;God is wonderful! We are so glad that God has all the power. We want God to help us to do the right thing;&quot; or</p></li><li><p>&quot;I do not want to listen to the false teachers anymore. I know that God will help me.&quot;</p></li></ul><p>You may want to sing the song that you made about this passage again!</p>\n<h2>Filling the Gaps</h2>\n<h2>Filling the Gaps</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of Jude 24–25 in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.</p><p>Jude says that God can make the people stand before God&apos;s <strong>glory</strong>. When God shows God&apos;s glory, people can see how beautiful, powerful, and majestic God is. So when people stand before God&apos;s glory, those people are in the wonderful, powerful, and majestic presence of God. It is as if those people are standing in God&apos;s throne room.</p><p>Stop here and discuss how you will say that God can make people stand before God&apos;s <strong>glory</strong>, or in God&apos;s glorious presence. Use the same word for glory as you have used in previous passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186553\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">glory</span> is in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.</p><p>God is our <strong>Savior</strong> through Jesus Christ. This means that God saves us because of what Jesus Christ has done for us. When you save someone, you rescue that person from a desperate situation. All of us are in a desperate situation, and we need God to save us. God saves us so that we can live forever in a good relationship with God.</p><p>Stop here and discuss what word you will use for <strong>Savior</strong>, or for &quot;God who saves,&quot; in this passage. Use the same word as you have used in other passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186512\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Savior</span> is in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.</p><p><strong>Christ</strong> means the special King and Savior that God had promised to send. It is the same word as Messiah. Use the same word as you have used in other passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186574\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Christ</span> is in the Master Glossary.</p><p>Jesus Christ is our <strong>Lord</strong>. A Lord means someone who has the highest authority over other people. Use the same word for Lord as you have used in previous passages. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186611\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Lord</span> is in the Master Glossary.</p><p>When Jude says that &quot;all <strong>glory</strong> be to God,&quot; Jude means that everybody should only praise and honor God. Glory is the fame and admiration that you gain by doing something impressive. When people give glory to God, those people praise God, admire God, and say good things about God. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186553\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">glory</span> is in the Master Glossary. It is the same word that Jude used when Jude talked about people standing before God&apos;s glory, but here Jude uses this word in a little different way.</p><p>When Jude says that &quot;all <strong>majesty</strong> be to God,&quot; Jude means that only God is the King, and that everybody should honor only God as King.</p><p>When Jude says that &quot;all <strong>power</strong> be to God,&quot; Jude means that God has all the power to do everything God wants. Someone who has power has authority. God can make everybody do what God wants. Jude wants all the people to acknowledge that God is the only one who has all the power in the world.</p><p>When Jude says that &quot;all <strong>authority</strong> be to God,&quot; Jude means that God has the right to rule, and to tell people what to do. The meaning of the word is somewhat similar to the word for power. Jude wants all the people to recognize that God is the one who is the only one who has all authority over all the people. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186527\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">authority</span> is in the Master Glossary. Use the same word as you have used in other passages.</p><p>Jude says that God&apos;s glory, majesty, power, and authority is forever. God always had this, and God will always have it. God will have these things for all <strong>eternity</strong>, which means forever and ever and ever! God had this before God created the world. And even if the earth would no longer exist, God would still be there and would still have glory, majesty, power, and authority!</p><p>Jude finishes this letter by saying <strong>Amen</strong>. Amen is a Hebrew word. This word means something like, &quot;May it be true.&quot; This word is a way for Jude to make clear that Jude has finished Jude&apos;s letter, and that Jude has nothing more to say.</p><p>Stop here and discuss what word or phrase you will use for <strong>Amen</strong>. Use the same word as you have used in other books of the Bible. The word <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"186520\" data-resourceType=\"FIAKeyTerms\">Amen</span> is in the Master Glossary.</p>\n<h2>Speaking the Word</h2>\n<h2>Speaking the Word</h2><p>Listen to an audio version of the passage in the easiest-to-understand translation.</p><p>In this session, retell the passage, as a group, in your own language.</p><p>First, the whole group should practice telling the passage in your own language. Remember to include the things you decided in previous steps, like chronology, words, phrases, emotions, or anything else you discussed.</p><p>One group member should tell a few sentences of the passage and pause. Another group member should tell the next part of the passage and pause. Do this until the group has retold the whole passage. The group members can correct each other in this step. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Next, each member of the group should tell the whole passage without interruption at least one time. A group member can use random objects, motions, or their storyboard to help them remember the passage. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Next, the group can decide whose version of the passage you like the most. You may decide that you liked the way one group member told one scene but you liked the way a different group member told another scene. Pause this audio here.</p><p>Finally, the group can put together a final version of the passage that everyone agrees on. Each group member should practice telling this final version of the passage.</p>",

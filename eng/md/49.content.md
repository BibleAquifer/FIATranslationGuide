Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 1:1–6 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Paul is writing a letter to the church at Ephesus. Most of Paul's letters to churches start with similar kinds of greetings. When Paul greets the people, he introduces himself. Then Paul tells who the letter is for. Then Paul blesses the people.

*Stop here and look at a map of Asia Minor with Ephesus marked. Notice the nearby cities and towns. Pause the recording here.*

Paul probably wrote this letter to the followers of Jesus who lived in Asia Minor. Asia Minor is the area of the country of Turkey today. Some of the followers of Jesus in Asia Minor were Jewish people who had decided to follow Jesus. Other followers of Jesus were Gentiles. This means that they were not Jewish. These people had only been followers of Jesus for a few years. The purpose of the letter seems to be to teach the new believers how to follow Jesus Christ well. Most translations say that the letter is to the church at Ephesus. However, most translators also agree that Paul probably does not identify Ephesus specifically. Scholars believe that Paul meant for messengers to read or preach the letter to several different churches in Asia Minor. The person who was reading the letter to each church would put the name of the church at the beginning where the name Ephesians is.

Paul had already spent three years in Ephesus. During that time, Paul taught many people about Jesus and what it means to be a follower of Jesus. When Paul remained in one city such as Ephesus for a period of time, Paul also taught those from the surrounding villages and towns. People from these towns came to Ephesus to listen to Paul teach and then took the teaching back to their churches. The followers of Jesus in these churches usually met in homes. People throughout the entire province of Asia Minor heard about Jesus and how to become a follower of Jesus. Sometime after Paul left Ephesus, the Roman government arrested Paul. Paul was in Rome as a prisoner when Paul wrote this letter.

*Stop here and look at the map showing Ephesus and the surrounding towns again. Notice Rome on the map and the distance between Rome and Ephesus. Pause the recording here.*

Paul starts the letter by identifying himself as the writer and as an apostle. As you may remember from the book of Acts, Paul is an apostle. People began using the title apostle for the 12 disciples after Jesus rose from the dead. An apostle is a person whom Jesus appointed and sent to tell others the message of the good news. Paul met Jesus in a vision and became a follower of Jesus. Jesus appointed Paul to be one of the apostles. Paul immediately began telling others about Jesus. Eventually Paul went with others on long journeys and visited many cities around the Mediterranean Sea. Paul started churches in many cities and then later wrote to the believers in those churches to encourage them to continue to follow Jesus well and to keep their churches strong. The churches would pass the letters to other churches who also read Paul's message.

Paul says that this letter is to the saints, or holy people, in Ephesus. God chose and set apart his people to be holy and to serve him. Saints are holy people, and all believers in Jesus are saints!

*Stop and discuss the following question as a group. Tell a story about someone who sent an important letter to a group of people. How do you begin important letters in your culture? If you don't send letters, talk about messages. Tell about someone who sent an important message to another place. How do you begin important messages or notices for your people? Pause this audio here.*

After Paul introduces the letter, he says thank you to God in the form of a prayer, as he usually does. We know that Paul thought that giving thanks like this was really important. Paul praises God for all the blessings or good things that God gives to those who believe in Jesus as their Lord and as their Savior, or Christ. Paul reminds us that God is the father of Jesus. Paul reminds us of the fact that Jesus is our Savior by calling Jesus our Lord, or master, and our Savior, or Christ. And most importantly, Paul reminds us that Jesus is God's son! Because of that, we receive spiritual blessings, or full life with God forever. We receive those wonderful things even now. These are things to praise God for!

Then Paul added more things to praise God for. God's people are so special to him that even before God created or built the world, God chose his people to be holy or set apart for God. Paul used a word picture of building or construction as Paul talks about the creation. Paul said that God laid the foundation for the world.

*Stop here and discuss the following question. Talk about how you build a house or other buildings. How do you prepare the foundation of the house or the first layer that goes in or on the ground? Talk about why the foundation or first layer of the house is important to the whole structure. Pause the audio here.*

Before God created the world, God chose his people. God's people are holy because Jesus has made us holy through what he did when he died on the cross. Therefore, God sees that his people are free from guilt for their sins, or blameless. God loved us. God took pleasure in us: he was happy to be with us. Therefore, when God chose us, he chose to adopt us, or to bring us into his family as his children. When someone adopts a child into their family, they give them the same rights and privileges as someone born into the family. This means that an adopted child even gets the same inheritance as a child born into the family. Jesus, our Savior, made this adoption possible. God chose us and gave us this glorious, or powerful, gift of adoption into his family even though we did not deserve it. We praise God because God's son, that he loves very much, Jesus, made this adoption possible. We belong to Jesus now!

*Stop here and discuss the following question. Tell a story about a family that adopted a child. Describe the rights and privileges that this child had. Talk about how adoption works in your village. Pause the audio here.*

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 1:1–6 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has 2 parts.

**In the first part:** Paul starts the letter by saying who wrote the letter and to whom Paul is writing. Paul asks God to bless the people with grace and peace.

**In the second part:** Paul prays to God in the same way as he does in almost every letter he writes to churches. Paul prays and thanks God for some of the things that God has done. The prayer reminds the people who are receiving the letter of some of the things that God has done.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The faithful saints at Ephesus, or those who will receive the letter
* God is mentioned. God inspired Paul to write these things in the letter.
* Jesus Christ is mentioned

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Paul starts this letter by saying, "I am the writer of this letter." Most likely, Paul spoke the letter out loud to someone who wrote it down. Then, someone else took the letter to the churches and read it out loud or preached it to the churches. Paul also says that God has chosen him to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, or the Savior Jesus. Paul both states his name and his role as an apostle in his greetings to the believers.

*Stop here and discuss as a group the best way to say that Paul is writing the letter and that God chose Paul to be an apostle of Christ Jesus. Pause the recording here.*

In this passage, the original language calls Jesus Christ Jesus, which puts the title Christ before the name Jesus. In other passages, the order may be different and say Jesus Christ. As we know, the title Christ means the special king and savior that God promised to send. "Christ Jesus" and "Jesus Christ" both mean the same thing. Later in this same letter, Paul says Jesus Christ.

*Pause the recording here and discuss the following question. Will it confuse your people if you sometimes say Christ Jesus and sometimes say Jesus Christ? If this is a problem for them, you may decide to always use the same order. You may need to talk with others before making this decision. Pause the recording here.*

Paul wanted people to read the letter out loud so that everyone would hear the letter and understand the letter. Paul sent the letter with someone who would be able to read this in a way that the people could understand. But the original language that Paul was using may be very different from the way you speak in your language. You may choose to say this letter in a way that is more like your language. Here is an example. You might say something like:

Praise to God. He is the God of our Lord Jesus Christ. He is also the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing.

These blessings come from the heavenly kingdoms.

We receive these blessings because we are united with Christ.

When you translate, remember that spiritual blessings are not the same as earthly blessings. Earthly blessings would be food, jobs, a house, and so forth. Spiritual blessings would be ways that God blesses our spirits with peace, joy, and other things that God sends us to encourage us and help us trust him more.

*Stop here and discuss the best way to say Paul's message so that your people will understand it clearly. Pause the recording here.*

In the second part of this passage, Paul thanks God for all the spiritual blessings that God has given those who believe in Jesus. Paul lists some of these blessings. Even before God created the universe, God loved us and prepared a plan for us. God chose us to be holy or without fault in God's eyes. God decided that God would adopt us into God's family because of what Jesus Christ has done for us.

*Stop here and remember the stories about adoption that you told in the previous step. Tell one of the stories again, and listen for the words you use to talk about someone adopting someone else into their family as full members of the family. Pause this audio here.*

God has willingly given God's glorious, or powerful, grace to those who follow God's son Jesus. Although Paul says that God has given us his grace through the "one he loves," or the "person he loves," we know that Paul is talking about God's son Jesus whom he loves very much. You may make it clear that God is talking about his son Jesus in your translation. Paul praises God for all these spiritual blessings.

*Stop here and practice describing the blessings that Paul says God has given his people. The other members of the team should listen for ways to list these blessings in a clear and natural way in your language. Pause the recording here.*

Choose people, drawings, or objects to be each one of the characters. As you begin to re\-tell the story of these verses, Paul points to God when Paul says that God chose Paul to be an apostle of Christ Jesus. Point to the believers at Ephesus when Paul says he is writing to them. When Paul asks for grace and peace for the believers, show God the Father and Jesus giving these things to the believers. Then, when Paul prays and asks God to bless the Ephesians, show that God is the one blessing them with spiritual blessings. As Paul lists each blessing, show each blessing. For example, when Paul says that God adopts believers into his family, show all the believers surrounding and welcoming a new believer into the family. Show that this new believer is exactly the same as those already in the family. Then show that the believers are praising God for the grace that he has given them because they are now part of his family as children.

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 1:1–6 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has 2 parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The faithful saints at Ephesus, or those who will receive the letter
* God
* Jesus Christ

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

*Pause this audio here and act out the passage.*

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

*Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.*

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

In part one, Paul writes to those who are members of the church in Ephesus and the area surrounding Ephesus. Paul starts the letter by saying that Paul is the writer. Paul is writing to the followers of Jesus at Ephesus. Then Paul says a brief prayer asking God to give the church at Ephesus grace and peace.

*Pause the drama.*

Ask the believers in Ephesus, "How are you feeling as you receive this letter?" You may hear, "I am so excited to have this letter. Paul knows so much about how to follow Jesus. I'm looking forward to hearing this and learning more about how to be a good follower myself." \[!end] Continue the drama.

In part two, Paul writes a prayer of praise thanking God for all the spiritual blessings that God has poured out on the believers. Paul reminds the believers that God has blessed them with every spiritual blessing. Even before God created the universe, God loved us and had a plan for us. God wanted us to be holy and without fault. God decided to adopt us into his own family and God did this through Jesus Christ. God has poured out grace on those who belong to Jesus. Jesus is God's own dear Son.

*Pause the drama.*

Ask those receiving the letter, "How do you feel knowing that God has adopted you?" You may hear, "I have heard others say this but this letter makes it seem so much more real. I really am a child of God. God is my father. If I'm God's child, no one can take this away from me. This is wonderful news and I know it's true." Or, "I doubt this. I can't believe God would see me as his child."

Ask those receiving the letter, "How do you feel knowing that you have received this grace that God has poured out on you?" You may hear, "Grace means receiving something I didn't deserve. I know I don't deserve this grace from God\-to be one of God's children through adoption. I could never do enough to earn this position or God's forgiveness. I could never earn this by being holy or without blame. I'm so glad that God has given it to me anyway. This is a reason to rejoice. I'm like Paul. I want to praise God for what God has done for me."

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 1:1–6 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Use the same names or words for **Paul**, **apostle** and **Christ** that you have used in your previous translations such as the Book of Acts. Apostle and Christ are discussed in the Master Glossary.

*Stop here and review the names that you have already chosen for these terms in other books of the Bible: Paul's name, the title for* ***Jesus Christ****, and the word* ***apostle****. You would use those same words here. Pause the audio here.*

God chose Paul by the **will of God**. "Will of God" is a phrase that means that this is what God intends, plans, or purposes. God planned to choose Paul as his apostle.

*Pause the recording here and select the best phrase in your language that expresses this same idea. If you have already translated this idea in another book of the Bible, use the same word or phrase that you have used there. Pause this recording here.*

Paul writes to the **saints**. Saint, or holy ones, describe those who believe that Jesus is the promised Savior. These "holy ones" are people who God chose and set apart to belong to him. Use the same word for saint that you have used in the translation of other books.

*If necessary, stop here and discuss what word or description you will use for* ***saint****.* *Saint* *is discussed in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.*

Paul asks God the **Father** and the **Lord** Jesus Christ to give God's saints **grace** and **peace**. Grace refers to God showing his favor to people who don't deserve this favor. Peace describes the good relationship with God that gives us full life.

*If necessary, stop here and discuss what words you will use for \_\_grace\_\_ and \_\_peace\_\_. Use the same words for grace and peace that you have used in previous translations.* *Grace* *and* *peace* *are discussed in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.*

Father refers to heavenly father or to God. Paul uses the same word for father that you use for your own fathers.

*If necessary, stop here and discuss how you will talk about God as a* ***Father*** *in this book. Use the same word for God as Father that you have used in other books of the Bible. Pause this audio here.*

Paul talks about the **Lord** Jesus Christ. A lord is a master or the person who is in control of everything.

*If necessary, stop here and discuss what word you will use for* ***lord****.* *Lord* *is discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same word for lord that you have used in other translations. Pause this audio here.*

Paul says that God has given us every **spiritual blessing** in the **heavenly realms**. Spiritual is a word that refers to God's Spirit or things from God. Here, spiritual blessing is different from good things in the world like good food or a good house. Spiritual blessings describe those blessings that come from God rather than from the material world, like peace and joy. Bless and spirit are discussed in the Master Glossary.

*Stop here and decide how to translate the phrase* ***spiritual blessing****. Pause the recording here.*

The heavenly realms is the kingdom where God lives and rules. At the time Paul wrote this letter, people believed that there were many layers or levels to heaven and God lived in the highest layer. This letter is referring to the place where God lives and rules.

*Stop here and decide how you will talk about the* ***heavenly realms****.* *Heaven* *is in the Master Glossary. Pause the recording here.*

God chose us to be **holy**, or set apart for service to him.

*If necessary, stop here and discuss what word you will use for* ***holy****.* *Holy* *is discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same word for holy that you have used in previous translations. Pause this audio here.*

God chose to **adopt** those who believe in Jesus. Use the same word for adopt that you have used in previous translations. To adopt someone is to take that person into the family with the same rights as one born to the parents. The parent sees no difference between an adopted child and a child born to them.

*If necessary, stop here and discuss what word you will use for* ***adopt****. Pause this audio here.*

God gave us this glorious grace, and we are thankful for it! We see God's glory, or majesty and power, when we see his grace.

*Stop here and discuss as a group how you will translate "We praise God for his glorious, or powerful, grace!"* *Glory* *is in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.*

Speaking the Word
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of the passage in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this session, retell the passage, as a group, in your own language.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 1:7–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Paul started this part of the letter by praising God for all the spiritual blessings that God has given to those who believe. In this passage Paul talks about more things to thank God for.

Paul wants those who are believers to know all that God has done for them. Paul has just been talking about Jesus the Savior or Christ, the One God loves. Paul has said that Jesus made it possible for believers to be God's children too. Paul goes on to say how God has redeemed the believers, or set them free with the blood of Jesus. When Paul says that God redeemed the believers, Paul is reminding the Jewish believers of the Passover in Egypt. When the Israelites were slaves, God freed them. God told the Israelites to spread the blood of the lamb they killed over their doors. This blood protected them from God's angel of death which killed the firstborn son of the Egyptians. Then the king of Egypt allowed the Israelites to leave. God told the Israelites to make this a special holiday called the Passover. Then they would always remember how the blood of a lamb on their doors freed them from slavery in Egypt. Paul is comparing Jesus to these sacrifices that the Israelites used to make in order to restore their relationship with God. Jesus, like those sacrifices, made us free, or redeemed us, with the blood of Jesus when he bled and died on the cross. Jesus really is the Christ, the Savior!

*Stop here and talk about a time where one person freed another person from slavery or from oppression. What did the person who rescued the others do? How do you feel when you hear this story of freedom? Pause the audio here.*

We do not deserve for God to send Jesus to free us. However, God loves us so much that he saves us anyway. Paul likes to talk a lot about the riches of God and about how much God likes to give people many gifts. Paul talks about the riches or large amount of God's grace. The image of this large amount of grace is like a fountain that overflows. So much comes from the fountain that the basin can't contain it. So much grace flows from God that we can't even take it all in or understand it. Paul says that God has showered God's kindness on us with wisdom and understanding. Paul uses the image of rain falling abundantly on the believer to show how wisdom and understanding fall on us.

*Stop here and talk about a time when someone gave you so many gifts that you couldn't carry them all or hold them all in your hands. How did you feel? Why did that person give you so many gifts? Pause the audio here.*

Paul also reminds the believers that God had a plan. This plan existed for a long time. But it's been a mystery, which means that only God could reveal it. Now God gives us his wisdom and understanding of his plan. God has revealed this plan to those who believe in Jesus. Then Paul tells the believers what the plan is. Paul says that everything in heaven and on earth will come together under the authority of Christ. Paul will make this clear later in the letter when Paul explains how Jesus as the head controls the believers, or the church. Paul doesn't explain these things here. Paul has already taught the people and this is just a reminder of this very important teaching.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 1:7–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has 2 parts.

**In the first part:** Paul continues to explain what God has done for those who believe in Jesus.

**In the second part:** Paul also explains the plan that God has had from the beginning and has now revealed to those who believe.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Ephesian followers of Jesus
* God who inspires Paul to write these things.
* Jesus Christ

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

The first part of this passage begins by referring to the One that God loves, who is Jesus our Savior, or Christ. It is *him*, or Jesus, who redeemed us or made us free. Now Paul tells us how Jesus made us free. Paul says that Jesus' blood made us free. Remember that Jesus' blood refers to Jesus' death on the cross. Blood was important in the Jewish sacrificial system, and it is important that Jesus bled and died. God made us free through Jesus' death because he wanted to give us many gifts even though we did not deserve them. When God made us free, he forgave us of all of our sins, or disobedience. We did not deserve this gift from God. Paul says that God gives us this grace, or undeserved gifts, because he is wealthy, or has so much to give us. Paul is showing us that God gives more than we expect, and we enjoy it more than we can imagine.

*Stop here and discuss as a group: Talk again about a time when someone gave you more good gifts than you imagined they would. How did you talk about it? Pay attention to the words you used to talk about how that person gave gifts because they had so much to give. Pause this audio here.*

In the second part of this passage, Paul talks about the plan that God showed his people. God gave wisdom to us, and helped us understand his plan. It makes God happy to show us his plan. God's plan involves Jesus Christ, the promised savior. This plan will happen when God's right time comes.

At the end of this passage, Paul reveals God's plan. God will give Jesus Christ authority over everything in heaven, where God lives, and over everything on earth.

Choose people, drawings, or objects to be each one of the characters. You may want to have a group of objects or people representing believers before they received freedom. As you begin to retell the story of these verses, Paul points to Jesus when he says that it is because of *Jesus' blood* when he died for us that God has redeemed us, or made us free. As God sends Jesus, and Jesus dies, show that the believers are free now. God shows that he has more grace, like a valuable treasure, than we can imagine. God takes from this grace and gives it to us. It is more than we can expect. Now Paul points to God and then the believers when he says that God joyfully gives the believers wisdom and understanding about his plan. Show how the believers do not know the plan at first, but God shows us his plan\-God uses Jesus to make his plan happen. In the right time, God places Jesus in authority over everything in heaven and earth. At the end of this passage, everything in heaven and earth is peacefully following Jesus' leadership. How will you show that Jesus has authority over everything?

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 1:7–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has 2 parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Ephesian followers of Jesus
* God who inspires Paul to write these things.
* Jesus Christ

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

*Pause this audio here and act out the passage.*

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

*Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.*

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

In scene one, God with the help of the Holy Spirit inspires Paul to write the letter. Paul explains that God used the blood of Jesus to free everyone who believes in Jesus. As well as giving us freedom, God forgave all our sins.

*Pause the drama.*

Ask Paul, "How do you feel knowing that God through the Holy Spirit is telling you to write these things in the letter?" You may hear, "This is wonderful. I am filled with awe or joy. God gives us so much more than we deserve. I always try to listen to God and teach what God wants the people to know." \[!end] Continue the drama.

Paul also explains God's mysterious plan to the Ephesians. The plan is that God, at the right time, will bring everything both in heaven and on earth under the authority of Jesus. The plan was a mystery\-people did not understand the plan until God revealed the plan.

*Pause the drama.*

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 1:7–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

This passage uses many words that you have already used in the book of Acts as well as other passages from the gospels.

*Stop here and review the words you have already chosen for* ***Christ*** *and* ***grace****. Use the same word for* *Christ* *and* *grace* *that you have used in previous passages. Each of these words is in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.*

In Jesus we have **redemption** for the **forgiveness** of our **sin**. Redemption means the same as redeem. When you redeem something, you set it free.

*Stop here and discuss the word you will use for* ***redemption****.* *Redeem* *is discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same word that you may have used in previous passages. Pause the audio here.*

God **forgave** our **sins**. Any time someone disobeys God, that person sins. When God forgives your sins, it is the same as if the sins don't exist. God no longer sees the sins.

*Stop here and discuss the words you will use for* ***forgiveness*** *and* ***sin****.* *Forgiveness* *and* *sin* *are discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same words for forgiveness and sin that you have used in other books of the Bible. Pause the audio here.*

God gave us **wisdom** and understanding. When you have wisdom, you think things that are true and make good decisions.

*Stop here and discuss what word you will use for* ***wisdom****. Use the same word that you have used in previous translations.* *Wisdom* *is in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.*

When you understand something, you can think or learn or even judge if something is right or not.

*Stop here and discuss the following question: What is the difference between memorizing something and understanding something such as a lesson at school? Understanding is more than just memorizing facts. How do you explain that difference? Pause the audio here.*

Jesus has authority over everything in **heaven** and on earth. Heaven is the place where God lives and rules. Sometimes heaven also refers to the place where any unseen powers or spirit beings might live. Jesus has authority over all of it. Use the same word for heaven that you have used in previous passages. Heaven is discussed in the Master Glossary.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 1:11–14 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Paul has been telling the believers in Ephesus about God's wonderful plan. Now Paul explains that God chose the believers, and the believers belong to God.

Paul starts by reminding the believers that they are united in Christ. This means that God has brought all the believers, both the Jews and the Gentiles, into one group together. The Jews were God's original chosen people from the time of Abraham. Jesus was a Jew. But now even non\-Jews, or Gentiles, can be God's chosen people. God chose all believers in Jesus as his special, chosen people. God's chosen people are like God's inheritance\-his special children just for him. Perhaps Paul is telling them that instead of God receiving them as his inheritance, they receive an inheritance from God because they are united with Jesus Christ. This makes them children of God, and like any child they have inheritance rights. In either case, people who believe in Jesus are special, chosen people. They do receive an inheritance from God, and God does make them his own people.

*Stop here and discuss the following question: Who has the right to inherit property or money when someone dies in your culture? Pause the recording here.*

Paul says that God chose us in advance, even before we became believers in Jesus. Paul compares God's choice to casting lots, which was when someone threw small objects to choose or select something or someone for a special purpose. The last time we heard about casting lots was in the book of Acts when the disciples chose someone to replace Judas as one of the apostles. Here, Paul says that God chose us to be God's people. It was God's will, or desire, to do this. God himself did this action\-people did not make it happen.

Why did God choose us? Paul says that God chose us so that we would bring praise and glory to God. Paul says that God first chose the Jews\-the people Paul describes as "we who were the first to trust in Jesus Christ, the promised savior." God chose the Jews so that they would praise God for his greatness. Then God went to the Gentiles with the good news. Paul has just reminded the believers that the Jews and Gentiles are united in Jesus.

Paul uses another word picture when he describes what happens to believers when they believe in Jesus. Some translations say that believers are marked with a seal. Other translations say that God identified believers as His own people. In the time when Paul wrote this letter, people often put a wax seal on an item to show who owned the item. People would melt the wax and then press an identifying object such as a ring into the melted wax. This image would be the identifying seal. Anyone who saw the seal would know that this object belonged to the person with that special mark.

*Stop here and look at a picture of a wax seal. Pause the recording here.*

*Stop here and discuss the following question: How do other people know that something belongs to you? Talk about the different things that you own and how people might know that these things belong to you. For example, a house, an animal, or your child. Pause the recording here.*

The purpose of this seal was to be a guarantee that the full payment would come later. Paul uses a business term. Sometimes, when you purchase something, you make a deposit of some money or a down payment. This guarantees that you will make the full payment later. This is the image that Paul has given the Ephesian believers. The believers received the Holy Spirit when they believed in Jesus. But they don't have the full inheritance yet. They will receive the full inheritance later when God accomplishes His plan. The Holy Spirit is like the deposit or down payment so that we can be sure that God will keep His promise to give his believers life forever with him.

*Stop here and tell a story about someone who gives someone else a first payment on something, promising to pay in full at a later date. In your culture, how do you give someone a guarantee that you will pay them in full later? Pause the recording here.*

Paul reminds the believers that God gave them God's Holy Spirit when they believed in Jesus. Only people who believe in Jesus have this Holy Spirit. This Holy Spirit identifies the believers as belonging to God. This is like the wax seal that Paul just referred to. The Holy Spirit guarantees that believers will receive the inheritance that God has promised to the people God has redeemed, or freed from sin, and who believe in him. When God looks at the believer who has the Holy Spirit, it is the same as looking at a wax seal with an identifying mark. God knows that this person belongs to God.

Paul finishes this section by telling the believers that God gave us this seal of the Holy Spirit so that we would praise God's glory, or praise God for his greatness.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 1:11–14 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has 2 parts.

**In the first part:** Paul says that we, the believers, are a special people to God. God chose us in advance to give praise and glory to God.

**In the second part:** Paul explains how the good news was first for the Jews and then for the Gentiles. Then Paul explains that all who believe in Jesus have the Holy Spirit and this Holy Spirit marks all believers as belonging to God. This mark is our guarantee that we will receive our inheritance. God has done all this so that we, the believers, would praise God's glory, or greatness.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Ephesian believers, including both Jews and Gentiles
* God inspires Paul to write these things.
* Jesus Christ
* The Holy Spirit

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In the first part of this passage Paul continues what he said in the previous passage. Paul says that believers are united or made one in Christ. Because believers follow Christ, they belong to God. There are two possible ways to understand the following part of the letter. Either all of these believers will receive an inheritance from God, or the believers themselves will become God's inheritance, which means that they become God's own people. Either way, whoever receives an inheritance in that culture receives it because they are part of the family. This means that because believers follow Jesus, they are part of God's special family. They belong to God and they receive God's promised inheritance. God decided to choose the believers as his own people long ago. God makes everything work just like God planned it.

*Stop here and discuss as a group: How will you translate this phrase: "God chose us to receive an inheritance"? or "God chose us to be his own inheritance, or his own people"? Remember that in either case, God is saying that the people who follow Christ belong to God. Pause this audio here.*

Paul says that God chose us in advance, or at an earlier time. Paul compares God's choice to casting lots, which was when someone threw small objects to choose or select something or someone for a special purpose. The last time we heard about casting lots was in the book of Acts when the disciples chose someone to replace Judas as one of the apostles. Here, Paul says that God chose us to be God's people. It was God's will, or desire, to do this. God himself did this action\-people did not make it happen.

*Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How will you talk about God choosing his people? How will you talk about this being God's plan even before the believers believed in Jesus? Pause this audio here.*

In the second part of this passage, Paul turns to the Jews and says that we, the Jews, were the first ones to put our hope in Christ, or to trust in Christ. Paul includes himself in the group of Jews because Paul is a Jew himself. Although Paul does not use the title "Jews" here, we know that Paul was talking about the Jews. This is because the Jews were the first people to put their hope in Christ, which means that they confidently expected Jesus to give them eternal life forever with God. This was God's plan. God did this so that the Jewish believers would praise God for his glory, or greatness.

Then Paul tells the Gentiles that now they have also heard the truth. Paul says that the truth is the good news that God saves them. God promised a long time ago that God would give this Holy Spirit to those who believe. This Holy Spirit is like a mark of identification or ownership. Anyone who sees that mark or the Holy Spirit will know that this person belongs to God. The Holy Spirit is God's guarantee that God will give us our inheritance that God has promised us because we belong to him. God will redeem us. This means that God will free us from our old life and give us new life with him. God has done all of this so that we can praise and glorify God.

*Stop here and remember the story you told in step 2 about giving a guarantee to someone that you will pay them in full later. Listen to how the storyteller describes this first payment. This will help you decide the best way to talk about this guarantee. Pause this audio here.*

Choose people, drawings, or objects to be each one of the characters.

As you begin to re\-tell the story of these verses, gather a group of Jewish believers and a separate group of Gentile believers. Paul shows that the Jewish and Gentile believers are united together in one group together with Jesus because of what Jesus Christ has done for all of them. This group should show that they are a special group that God has chosen. Perhaps it means that God will give them an inheritance. Perhaps it means that the group is God's inheritance. Either way, the group is very special to God. How can you show this? Paul points to God and says that God makes everything work according to His plan\-God planned for this group to be together.

Paul then points to the Jewish believers and says that God chose the Jewish believers first. God's plan was that the Jewish believers would praise God for his glory or greatness. As Paul says this, the Jewish believers can show that they are praising God.

Paul turns to the Gentile believers and says, "You Gentiles have also heard the good news that God saves you." Paul points to the Holy Spirit who moves to join with the believers. Paul says that the Holy Spirit is God's guarantee, or promise of payment. The Holy Spirit marks the believers so that God knows they belong to God when God looks at them. Have the Holy Spirit move among the believers and mark each one in some way. Paul points back to God and says to the believers, "You are God's people. God has freed you from sin. God did this so that you can praise and glorify God." Have the believers praise and glorify God as Paul says this.

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 1:11–14 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has 2 parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Ephesian believers, including both Jews and Gentiles
* God inspires Paul to write these things.
* Jesus Christ
* The Holy Spirit

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

*Pause this audio here and act out the passage.*

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

*Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.*

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

In Part 1, Paul says that believers are united in Christ. Each believer has an inheritance that God planned for those who believe. Paul says that God chose his special people, the believers, in advance or before they believed. God makes everything work according to his plan.

*Pause the drama.*

Ask one of the believers, "How do you feel knowing that God chose you in advance? You may hear, "I am in awe, I don't know why. I wasn't a good person. It's so good to know that God chose me even with all my faults. I'm one of God's own people now. I can't believe I'm so special to God! This is good news." \[!end] Continue the drama.

In Part 2, Paul explains that the Jews first and then the Gentiles have heard the truth of the good news. Once they believed, they received the Holy Spirit. God sees this as the mark of identification that shows that they belong to God. No one can mistake this mark and think they belong to someone else. This mark of the Holy Spirit is the guarantee for all believers that each one will receive his inheritance from God. God redeemed us, or freed us from sin and to be God's own people. God did this so that we can praise and glorify God.

*Pause the drama.*

Ask the Ephesians, "How do you feel about having this mark of identification?" You may hear, "I love it. I'm so glad that there can be no doubt. I'm confident that I belong to God. No one can take this away from me. Because of this and what God has done, I want to praise God all the time."

Ask Paul, "Why do you think God told you to write about the Holy Spirit being a guarantee or down payment on their future inheritance?" You may hear, "This is an image that the people understand. They all know about making a down payment or a deposit on something. They know that this means that they will have eternal life in the future. I think God wants them to understand that they belong to God and nothing can change that. That assurance is very comforting to the believers. I also think God wants them to know for sure that they will receive even more in the future when they get their full inheritance."

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 1:11–14 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Use the same word for **Christ** that you have used in previous translations. Christ is discussed in the Master Glossary.

In some translations, Paul says that the believers have an **inheritance** from God, or that the believers are God's inheritance. Inheritance refers to the property or money that a father gives his children when the father dies.

*Stop here and discuss what description you will give in your translation for* ***inheritance****. Translate inheritance in the same way you have translated it in other books of the Bible. Pause this audio here.*

Paul reminds the Ephesians that the **Jews** were the first people to accept the **good news** or **gospel** by saying that "we were the first to put our hope in Christ." Then Paul says that God included the **Gentiles** in his people when they heard the gospel and accepted it. Gospel is another word for the good news that Jesus died to save people from their sins and that if we believe, we have life forever with God in heaven.

*Stop here and discuss as a group what words you will use for good news, or gospel.* *Good news* *or* *gospel* *are discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same word that you have used in previous translations. Pause this audio here.*

The Jews were Abraham's descendants and God's chosen people. The Gentiles were anyone who was not a Jew. Jesus was a Jewish person, and that's why most of the first believers in Jesus were Jewish.

*Stop here and discuss the following question as a group: Some translations include the names for* ***Jew*** *and* ***Gentile*** *in their translations to make it clear who Paul is talking about. Discuss how you want to talk about the different groups of believers.* *Jews* *and* *Gentile* *are both in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.*

Believers praise God's **glory**, or his greatness or power.

*Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for* ***glory****. Remember that* *glory* *is in the Master Glossary.*

The **Holy Spirit** is God's **seal** that **guarantees** that God will give us the inheritance that God promised. Other words for guarantee are pledge, down payment, deposit, or the first part of what God has promised. Once someone pays this initial amount, this amount is used as the guarantee that they will pay the rest of the price.

*Stop here and look at the picture of a seal again if needed. Pause the recording here.*

*Stop here and discuss what word or phrase you will use for* ***Holy Spirit****. Use the same words you have used in previous books of the Bible, and remember that* *Holy Spirit* *is in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.*

*Stop here and discuss as a group: How will you talk about the Holy Spirit being God's guarantee that God will give us the inheritance that he promised? Pause this audio here.*

The Holy Spirit is our guarantee that God will **redeem** us, or obtain our freedom from slavery to sin so that we can be God's own people. In other passages, we understand that God obtained us through the blood of Jesus Christ. Use the same word for redeem that you used in previous passages, and remember that redeem is in the Master Glossary.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 1:15–23 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this passage Paul starts another prayer. Paul is writing to those who follow Jesus. This prayer asks God to help God's people understand and know God better.

Paul tells the followers of Jesus in Ephesus that Paul has heard how the believers trust in Jesus and how they love other believers. Paul says that Paul has been continually praying for the followers of Jesus who live in Ephesus. At that time many devoted Jews spent hours each day praying. Paul was a devoted Jew before becoming a follower of Jesus. It seems that Paul still spends hours each day in prayer. In this prayer, Paul not only thanks God for the believers, asks God to make the believers strong, but also reminds the believers of God's power and authority.

Paul gives God two titles. The first title describes God as the God that Jesus worshiped. The second title describes God as the Father in heaven who has great glory. This is the only time that Paul uses this title for God. Paul gives God great honor when Paul calls God the "Glorious Father." Paul is saying that God is the source of all beauty, honor, and majesty. In this passage, Paul says that the God of Glory is the father of those who believe in Jesus.

Paul asks God to give the believers spiritual wisdom and insight. Paul wants these believers to understand that God has given the believers much hope, many riches from his glorious inheritance, and much power. Paul talks about hope, riches, and power many times in this letter. Paul says that we all have a hope, or eager expectation, that God will save us. God is inviting us to expect this salvation. Paul also says that along with this salvation comes riches, or great wealth, because we are children of God, saints who are holy, or set apart for him. Just like a child receives an inheritance from his parents, we will receive an inheritance from our Father God. This inheritance, or great wealth, is that God freely saves us and gives us a full life with him, even though we do not deserve it. God also says that he gives us strong power to believe in him and follow him.

Paul wants the believers to understand what God is showing them. Paul uses a word picture to describe this. The picture Paul uses is of a bright light shining into a dark place. The bright light is like spiritual wisdom and insight. The dark place is like the hearts of the believers. For the Ephesian believers the heart was the center of emotions and understanding.

*Stop here and tell a story about a person who loves someone very much. Listen to the storyteller. What part of the body does the storyteller use to describe this emotion? Some cultures might use the stomach or the liver rather than the heart. Pause this audio here.*

*Stop here and hide some things in a dark place. Then go to the dark space. Ask the participants to find the things you have hidden. Then turn on several bright lights so that there is no shadow in the room and ask the participants to find these hidden things. Discuss the difference that light makes. Pause this audio here.*

Now Paul begins to teach the believers. Paul describes this power God has given us. God helps us in powerful ways. This is truly great power! God raised Jesus from the dead, so we know that God has power that we cannot even imagine. Paul says that God gives this same power to those who follow Jesus. Paul reminds the believers that Jesus is seated at the right hand of God, which is the most important and powerful place in God's kingdom.

*Stop here and tell a story about the most important person in your village or area. Describe where this person now sits. Where would the king or leader of the country want this person to sit if he has the highest honor or position in the kingdom? In your home, where would you place the most important guest? Pause this audio here.*

Paul reminds the believers that Jesus is more powerful or stronger than any other ruler or power or authority both on earth and in the heavenly places. Jesus is stronger now, and Jesus will always be stronger than any other spiritual being. When Paul talks about rulers in the heavenly places, Paul was talking about spiritual powers like angels or demons. Paul says that Jesus is more powerful than even the most important of these spiritual beings. For believers living in Ephesus and the surrounding area, this fact was very important. There was a very important pagan temple in Ephesus. Everyone could see this temple from anywhere in the city. Before becoming believers, most of these believers would have worshiped at that pagan temple and followed magic and sorcery. Now, Paul wants to remind the Ephesian believers that Jesus has far more authority than the evil spirits related to this pagan temple worship. Paul knows about the evil spirits in Ephesus because Paul spent time in Ephesus. The story of Paul's time in Ephesus is in the book of Acts.

Paul tells the believers all the honors that God has given Jesus. Paul says that God has given Jesus all authority over everything and completes everything. God has done this for the benefit of the church. Then Paul uses another word picture. Paul describes a human body with a head, body, and feet. God has placed everything under Jesus' feet. Paul says that Jesus is the head or chief of the church. The church is the body of Christ.

*Stop here and discuss the following question. Tell a story about a time when you or other believers had to make choices about which powerful god or authority you would trust and follow. How did you or they determine who was more powerful?*

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 1:15–23 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has 2 parts.

**In the first part:** Paul starts a new prayer for the believers. Paul prays that their hearts will be filled with light so that they can understand the gift of hope that they have been given.

**In the second part:** Paul continues by telling the followers of Jesus about the power that they now have as believers. This power is greater than any other power, even greater than the power of the spirits that they can't see. Paul also reminds them that Jesus has authority over everything.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Ephesian believers
* God who inspires Paul to write and receives Paul's requests
* Jesus who has authority over everything
* Spiritual forces in the world

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In the previous section, Paul talked about the wonderful things that God had done for the believers. Paul starts this section by praying for the believers. Paul says that he is praying for them because of all the good things God has done. Paul says that he has heard two things about the believers. First, Paul has heard that the believers have faith in Jesus, or trust Jesus. Paul has also heard that the believers love God's people, or those who follow God. Every time Paul prays, he thanks God for the believers. Paul says that he prays to the God of "our Lord, or master, Jesus Christ." God is glorious, or majestic and full of power, and God is like a Father to us.

*Stop here and discuss the title for Jesus that Paul gives him: "Lord Jesus Christ." This is a respectful title that recognizes Jesus as our master and as God's appointed savior. How do you refer to Jesus when you are honoring him? Pause this audio here.*

*Stop here and tell a story about someone who has done great things. People want to praise this person. Listen to the words of praise the storyteller uses. Now decide how you will say the title of God that Paul uses in this passage. Pause the recording here.*

Paul asks God, our Glorious Father, to give the believers two things. Paul asks God to give the believers spiritual wisdom, or wisdom from God. Paul also asks God to give the believers revelation. Paul wants God to reveal himself and what he does to the believers.

*Stop here and discuss as a group: How do you talk about God revealing to people who he is and what he does? Pause this audio here.*

Perhaps the way that God does that is to "open the eyes of their heart." This is special language\-Paul is asking God to show the believers truth and information about God, like a light shows things more clearly when it shines in a dark place.

*Stop here and discuss: "Open the eyes of the heart" is a word picture. Another word picture that gives the same idea is "fill the heart with light." The Ephesians believed that emotions lived in the heart, or that the heart was the center of emotions and understanding. What word picture would you use in your culture that says the same thing? You might tell a story in which you are praying that someone will understand something important. Listen to see how you talk about understanding something important or revealing new truth to someone. Pause the audio here.*

Then Paul explains what he wants the believers to know: Paul wants the believers to understand the hope of their calling to follow God. This means that God is inviting the believers to trust that God will save them and give them full life forever with God. Paul also wants the believers to understand that God is giving his holy people, or saints, an inheritance, or everything God has. This is just like a father gives his children everything he has. It is like great riches, but here God is not giving us money! God is giving us his great and strong power.

*Stop here and discuss as a group: Tell a story about a time you eagerly expected something great to happen to you. Pay attention to the words you use to talk about that. Pause this audio here.*

In the second part of this passage, Paul tells the believers what he wants them to remember about God and Jesus. We know that God can give us great power, because we have seen what God has done for Jesus. God raised Jesus from the dead! And, even more, God seated Jesus at the place of honor at his right hand in heaven, where God lives. Jesus is above all authority, all rulers, all power, and all dominion or rule. Jesus is above every other name that people will ever use to gain power. Remember that these things are all the different kinds of spiritual authorities. Jesus has authority over all of the spiritual world, including any spiritual beings not mentioned. Jesus has this authority now, but he also has this authority forever\-in the future when God finally destroys all evil.

*Stop here and discuss the power that Jesus and the believers have. How does knowledge of this power help your people to understand that Jesus has more power than any other spiritual being? Pause the audio here.*

Paul uses special language again here to tell us that God gave Jesus authority over everything. God placed "all things under Christ's feet," which is a way to say that everything is "under" Jesus. Nothing is as important as Jesus. God made Jesus the "head" of the body. Paul compares the human body to the members of the church or groups of believers. The head of a physical body controls the body. In the same way, Jesus controls the church. The body, or the church, is "the fullness of Jesus who fills everything in every way." Most likely, Christ fills or completes the church with his life and power, because Christ fills or gives power to everything. It is possible that the church also completes Christ, or shows the completeness of Christ to the world.

*Stop here and discuss this word picture of the head and the body. How do you describe this word picture to your people? Remember that the head directs the body in everything that the body does. Pause this audio here.*

*Stop here and discuss what the church does when Christ "fills" or "completes" it. How do you know when Christ fills a church? What do they do to show that? Pause this audio here.*

Now the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. Choose people, drawings, or objects to be each one of the characters.

As you begin to retell the story of these verses, remember Paul shows that he is talking to the believers, and God and Jesus are standing nearby. A group of spiritual forces in the world are also standing nearby. Paul shows them that he is happy because he has heard that the believers trust Jesus and love people. Then Paul shows that he is asking God to show the believers important truths about himself. Paul should show that before, the believers did not see everything about God's plan, but now, Paul asks God to show the believers the full truth of God. The believers can show that they are discovering God's inheritance for them and God's great power for them.

Now Paul turns to the believers. Paul explains about God's power to them. God and Jesus are standing next to each other, and Paul shows the believers that God raised Christ, our Savior, from the dead. Then Paul shows that Christ is sitting next to God in heaven where they live, on the right side of God. Jesus shows that Jesus rules over all the spiritual forces in the world. Show that these spiritual forces are below Jesus, or under his authority.

Now Paul explains that Jesus is the head, or leader, of the church. Show that Jesus is a good leader. Show Christ Jesus filling the church with his presence\-perhaps Christ could come and stand among the believers as the believers show what they do as a church together.

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 1:15–23 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has 2 scenes.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Ephesian believers
* God who inspires Paul to write and receives Paul's requests
* Jesus who has authority over everything
* Spiritual forces in the world

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

*Pause this audio here and act out the passage.*

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

*Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.*

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

In scene one, Paul begins a new prayer. Paul tells the Ephesians that Paul prays for them every time Paul prays to God. As Paul prays, Paul thanks God for the believers. Paul also prays that the God of Glory will give the Ephesians spiritual wisdom. Paul wants the believers to grow in their understanding or knowledge of God. Paul uses the word picture of light filling a space so that there are no shadows. This picture helps the believers recognize how they can understand the hope that God has given them.

*Pause the drama.*

Ask the Ephesian believers, "How does it make you feel to know that Paul prays for you constantly?" You may hear, "I like knowing that Paul remembers me and prays for me and my family even when Paul isn't here. I try to follow Jesus and learn more, but sometimes it's hard. Knowing that Paul is praying for me helps me grow stronger in my faith."

Ask God, "How do you feel when you hear Paul's prayers?" You may hear, "Paul has understood that it is important to remain in communication with me. I wish all believers would do the same as Paul and spend time every day in prayer. I have told the people that prayer is important, and Paul demonstrates through his actions that prayer is important. I like talking with those who follow me." \[!end] Continue the drama.

In scene two, Paul continues to pray. Paul wants God to help the believers to understand that they have power. This power is the same power that God used to raise Jesus from the dead. Paul tells the Ephesians that this power is far greater than the power of any other spirit beings, even those spirit beings that they can't see.

*Pause the drama.*

Paul reminds the believers that God has made Jesus the highest authority. God has put all things under the authority of Jesus. That includes everything we have in the present world and in the world to come. God has also made Jesus the leader or head of the church. The church is the body of Christ.

*Pause the drama.*

Ask Paul, "Why do you think it is important to remind the believers that Jesus is the head of the church and they are the body of the church?" You may hear, "I want them to listen to the voice of Jesus tell them what to do in the church. I've seen what happens when believers become divided in their understanding, beliefs, and actions. As long as they remember that Jesus is the head and tells them what to do, they will stay strong. Jesus loves the church and wants the church to grow in faith and be strong."

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 1:15–23 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul talks about the **faith** of the Ephesians, or how they trust the Lord Jesus. Faith is discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same word for faith that you have in previous translations.

Paul uses the title **Lord** Jesus **Christ** throughout this passage. This title means that Jesus is God. Lord is a respectful title that shows that Jesus is master, and really is God. Christ refers to Jesus' position as Messiah, or the savior that God promised to send. Lord and Christ are discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same word for Lord and Christ that you have used in previous passages.

Paul uses the word **saint** to refer to anyone who believes in Jesus as Savior and Lord. Saints are people who are holy, or set apart for God's service. Use the same word for saints you have used before, and remember that saints is discussed in the Master Glossary.

Paul calls God the God of **Glory** or the Glorious Father, meaning that God is full of majesty and power. Use the same word for glory that you used in the previous passage, and remember that glory is discussed in the Master Glossary. This letter to the Ephesians is the only place in scripture where we find this exact title for God.

Paul asks God to give the believers spiritual **wisdom**, or a **spirit** or attitude of wisdom. Paul wanted the believers to think things that are true and do things that are good. Because this is spiritual wisdom, their understanding of spiritual truths would come from God. Use the same word for wisdom that you have used in previous passages, and see the Master Glossary for more information.

God has given his saints his glorious, or wonderful, **inheritance**. Use the same word for inheritance that you used in the previous passage.

God put Jesus at God's right hand, which is the place of honor. God gave Jesus authority over everything or every power on earth and everything in the **heavenly realms**, or kingdoms. Use the same expression for heavenly realms, or kingdoms, that you have used in previous passages. The Ephesians believed that the heavenly realms had different layers with God being in the highest layer. In between the earth and the highest layer of heaven lived spirit beings, here called the heavenly rulers, authorities, powers, and lords or masters. These descriptions of spirit beings all mean the same thing. They do not refer to spirits that are necessarily good or evil beings. Jesus has authority over all spirit beings, both good and evil, except for God the Father himself. Use the same word for **heaven** as you have used in previous passages, and remember that heaven is in the Master Glossary.

Paul talked about the authority of Christ over the **church**. The word church means a group of people who believe in Jesus as their savior. These people meet together to worship God, pray, and study God's Word. The word church does not refer to a building.

*Stop here and discuss as a group what word you will use for* ***church****. Use the same word for* *church* *that you have used in previous books of the Bible, and see the Master Glossary for more information. Pause this audio here.*

Jesus is the head of the church, and the church is Jesus' body. This word picture shows how Jesus has complete authority over all that the church does.

*Stop here and decide how you will explain that Jesus has authority over the church.*

Speaking the Word
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of the passage in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this session, retell the passage, as a group, in your own language.

First, the whole group should practice telling the passage in your own language. Remember to include the things you decided in previous steps, like chronology, words, phrases, emotions, or anything else you discussed.

One group member should tell a few sentences of the passage and pause. Another group member should tell the next part of the passage and pause. Do this until the group has retold the whole passage. The group members can correct each other in this step. Pause this audio here.

Next, each member of the group should tell the whole passage without interruption at least one time. A group member can use random objects, motions, or their storyboard to help them remember the passage. Pause this audio here.

Next, the group can decide whose version of the passage you like the most. You may decide that you liked the way one group member told one scene but you liked the way a different group member told another scene. Pause this audio here.

Finally, the group can put together a final version of the passage that everyone agrees on. Each group member should practice telling this final version of the passage.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 2:1–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In the previous passage Paul talked about the power that God gave believers, and how God gave Jesus Christ all authority because Jesus has all power over evil spirits. Now Paul contrasts our lives before we became followers of Jesus with our lives after we became followers. Before we became followers, it was like we were dead, and after, it is like we are fully alive. Only God can do this!

Paul tells the Gentiles what their life was like before they became followers of Jesus. Paul says they followed the ruler of the kingdom of the air. The ruler of the kingdom of the air is Satan, or the Devil. People believed that Satan and evil spirits ruled the lowest heaven or the air around them. This is far below God's kingdom where God and the angels live. Paul tells the Gentiles that Satan leads people to disobey God's commandments. When people live in this way, they are like dead people. Dead people cannot respond to God. Paul says that we all used to be like this. All of us behaved just like those people who chose to disobey God. Paul has been talking to the Gentiles, but now Paul includes himself and the Jewish believers when Paul says that we all followed our sinful nature.

Paul talks about our sinful nature. Another way of describing this is to talk about the selfish desires of our bodies and minds. When Paul talks about our nature, Paul is talking about the way we were born. Paul is saying that all of us did just what we wanted to do. We did whatever our minds imagined or whatever our bodies wanted us to do. You could say that we followed the natural desires we have as people. Because of these choices, we all deserved God's wrath. God's wrath or anger is the emotion that God feels when God sees someone sin or disobey Him. Wrath is God's hatred of sin because God is holy, or pure, and just. All of us deserved that wrath just like everyone who does not follow Jesus. However, we also know that God has mercy for those who follow Jesus.

*Stop here and discuss this question as a group. Tell a story about someone who has disobeyed God and has lots of pride. Listen to how the storyteller describes this person. What words would you use to describe the sinful nature of this individual? Pause the audio here.*

Paul talks about what God does for people when they become followers of Jesus. Firstly, God gives us new life because he loves us so much. Paul says we were dead because of our sins. This means that in God's eyes, we were like dead people.

Now Paul talks about the opposite of death\-life! God brought Jesus back to life. God gives us life in the same way. God does this because he is rich in mercy, or full of mercy. God shows kindness to someone who is in need. Paul tells the believers that they only have this new life because of God's grace. In other words, God gives us things we don't deserve.

Paul goes even further\-we are not only fully alive now, but we rule with Christ! Paul tells the followers of Jesus that God has united us, or put us together with Christ. Paul says that Christ sits with God in the heavenly realms. This means that as believers we also sit with God in heaven. Heaven is where God lives and rules. When a person is seated with God, that means that they help rule with God, and they share in the glory, or power and majesty, of Christ. We know that someday all believers will rule with Christ, but Paul is saying that even now, although we still live on this earth, we share in Christ's power and majesty. God did this so that in all the years to come the whole world will see how rich God is. They will not see this richness as wealth in money, but as wealth in kindness. Again, Paul emphasizes that God gives his people wealth in a different way than money.

Paul is showing the opposite of our dead, sinful nature, and showing how God gives us life.

Now Paul summarizes this difference between being spiritually dead and becoming spiritually alive. He reminds the believers that God's life is a gift. God gives us this gift even though we do not deserve it. We get this gift because we have faith, or believe in God. We can't boast or say that we received God's life because we are good people or did anything special to deserve it.

*Stop here and review some of the stories of Jesus where Jesus forgave someone's sins or healed a person just because the person believed. That person did nothing to earn this forgiveness or healing. How does Paul's teaching explain what happened when the person met Jesus? Pause the audio here.*

Paul emphasizes again the contrast between being dead and being alive. He says that believers are God's masterpiece. The Ephesians had many gifted craftsmen and artists who made beautiful statues and other pieces of art. But the statues were not alive. Paul uses this same idea of an artist or craftsman when saying that the believers are God's masterpiece. God is the artist, and he has made us what we are now as believers. We are not stone idols or statues. We are alive. God is the creator. God has created us anew in Jesus. God did this so that we, the believers, can do the good things that God planned for us to do. God made this plan from the beginning of the world.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 2:1–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has 3 parts.

**In the first part:** Paul starts by talking to the Gentiles. Paul explains how people are spiritually dead when they follow Satan's ways and disobey God. Paul then includes himself and the Jews and explains that everyone disobeys God and listens to Satan. This is the way they lived before they believed in Jesus.

**In the second part:** Paul explains the richness of God's mercy. When God raised Jesus from the dead, God gave life to those who believed in Jesus. God did this because of God's grace and kindness. Because of this, those who believe in Jesus will be seated with Jesus in heaven and rule with Jesus.

**In the third part:** Paul explains that salvation comes only from God's grace. No one can earn salvation or eternal life with God. Believers are God's masterpiece. God has given believers new life so that believers can do the good things God planned for us to do.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* God who inspires Paul to write this letter
* Jesus Christ
* The Ephesian believers, both Gentiles and Jews
* Satan, or the ruler of the kingdom of the air

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In the first part of this passage, as Paul begins this section, Paul talks to the Gentiles. Then Paul changes his way of talking so that Paul includes both the Gentiles and the Jews in the teaching about what God has done for them.

*Stop here and discuss. Tell a story that involves two groups of people. Have the storyteller start by talking directly to one group. Then the storyteller should include himself and the other group of people as he continues telling the story. Now discuss how the storyteller changed from talking about you to talking about us. Pause the audio here.*

First Paul talks about how the believers used to be spiritually dead because they disobeyed God. They were just like the rest of the people before they believed in Jesus. They followed Satan. Paul talks about Satan and the way Satan works in the hearts of those who refuse to obey God. Some translations use the name Satan. Other translations talk about the ruler of the powers of the air or the ruler of the kingdom of the air. One translation says the commander of the powers in the unseen world. The kingdom of the air, or the unseen world, is the place where those beings that we can't see exist, such as evil spirits. Satan rules over the evil spirits.

*Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do you describe the person in charge of evil beings that we cannot see? What is this person's name? Tell a story about this person. Listen to the storyteller to see if the storyteller uses a name or a description. Pause this audio here.*

In the second part of this passage, Paul contrasts how the followers of Jesus used to be dead, but now they are alive. Paul tells the Ephesian followers of Jesus that it was like they were dead when they were disobeying God. Paul means that they were spiritually dead and would not be with God forever when they died. Now that the followers of Jesus believe in Christ, it is like they are truly alive. God gave them spiritual life when God raised Christ from the dead. That means that now, believers in Jesus will live with God forever, even after they die.

*Stop here and discuss: Tell a story about someone who was spiritually dead but came to life again when they believed. Listen carefully to the storyteller. What words or ideas does the storyteller use to explain this idea so that people understand that someone can be spiritually dead and physically alive at the same time? Pause the audio here.*

Paul continues telling the believers about their new life in Christ. Paul reminds them that they did not earn or deserve this new life. They have this new life because God in his grace gave it to them. Paul tells them that they will be seated with God in heaven because they are united with Christ. When someone is united with someone else, they follow that person and trust them. When we are united with Christ, we will sit next to God and Christ and we will rule with Christ from the place where God rules. God wants to show to the people in the future that he has grace\-that he is kind and gives people so many good things that they do not deserve.

In the third part of this passage, Paul tells the believers again that their salvation comes only from God's grace. Paul repeats this teaching because it is such an important truth. The believers did not do anything except believe. Salvation is not a reward for their good works. Paul says that God has created us as new creatures. God made us new creatures who are fully alive and rule with Christ so that we can do the good things God planned for us to do from the beginning of the world.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. Select people or objects to represent each of the characters. As Paul begins talking, have Paul point to the Gentiles. Show how the Gentiles follow the Kingdom of the Air, or Satan. Then Paul includes himself and the Jews along with the Gentiles as Paul explains the way we used to live. Have Paul, the Gentiles and the Jews move together for this speech.

*Pause here and discuss how to show that people are spiritually dead. Pause the audio here.*

Then have Paul point to God as Paul explains the good things that God has done for the believers. As Paul says this, show God giving his riches to people in the form of good things. As Paul mentions each thing, have that person act it out. For example, God raised Jesus from the dead. God raised the believers from their spiritual death. God has seated the believers with God in the heavenly realms. The believers are united with Christ, so Christ invites the believers to sit with him next to God.

Have Paul point first to God and then to the believers as Paul tells them again that their salvation comes from God's grace. They have done nothing and cannot do anything to earn their salvation. Salvation is not a reward for good works. God has created us as new creatures so that we can do the good things that God has planned for us to do. These new creatures are alive and with God because God has made them alive. These new creatures are God's masterpiece. Show the believers doing things that people who are alive and following God would do. This should show a big contrast between when you acted like you were spiritually dead, and now when you are acting alive.

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 2:1–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has 3 parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* God who inspires Paul to write this letter
* Jesus Christ
* The Ephesian believers, both Gentiles and Jews
* Satan, or the ruler of the kingdom of the air

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

*Pause this audio here and act out the passage.*

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

*Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.*

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul talks to the Gentile believers. Paul reminds them that before, they were spiritually dead because they had disobeyed God. Paul says that they lived just like everyone else when they followed Satan and obeyed what Satan said to do. Then Paul explains how Satan works. Paul includes himself and the Jewish believers along with the Gentile believers when Paul says that we all lived like that. Paul said it was because we each have a sinful nature. As a result of our actions, we deserved God's wrath or God's punishment.

*Pause the drama.*

Ask the Gentile believers, "How do you feel when you hear Paul include himself and the Jewish believers when Paul talks about the sinful nature?" You may hear, "I'm relieved! Now, I understand. It doesn't matter what your background is or the religion you followed. Every one of us disobeyed God. We are all equal in our disobedience. That means we are all the same in God's eyes. God doesn't see me differently from the others. God saw me as dead and then when I believed in Jesus, God saw me as alive. This is such good news for all of us." \[!end] Restart the drama.

Paul tells the believers that God gave the believers new life when they became followers of Jesus. God did this because he is full of mercy and because he loves the believers so much. This is spiritual life. Paul tells them that their salvation is through God's grace because God wanted to give them the gift of life. God has seated the believers with God in heaven. The believers are united with Jesus Christ. God will show others what God has done for those who believe. People in the future will know that we are united with Christ Jesus because of God's grace and kindness.

*Pause the drama.*

Paul continues talking about God's grace and how we get to sit with God in heaven. Paul reminds all the believers that they did absolutely nothing to earn their salvation. God gave it to them even though they didn't deserve it. Their salvation is not a reward for their good deeds. Anyone who believes in Jesus will be saved. Paul says that this is so that no one can brag about their good deeds. Paul also tells the believers that God has made them into new creatures, or good works of art, so that they can do the good things that God has planned for them to do.

*Pause the drama.*

Ask the believers how they feel about doing the good things that God planned for them to do. You may hear, "I do these things to please God or to thank God. I do these things because I want to do them for God. I'm so glad to know that these things are the result of my salvation. I can't do good things to earn my salvation. But I can do good things to thank God for saving me. It's a part of how I show my love for God."

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 2:1–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

**Christ** is used throughout this passage. Christ is discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same word for Christ that you have been using.

Paul talks about our sins and our trespasses. **Sin** means that you disobeyed God or refused to listen to God's commandments. **Trespass** means that you have gone beyond the limits of what is right or moral. You have broken the will or law of God by some failure or action. Sin and trespass often go together and there is very little difference in meaning. Sin is discussed in the Master Glossary.

*Stop here and discuss the word you will use for* ***sin****. You may use the same word for sin that you have been using. Discuss the word you will use for* ***trespass****. If you have used this word before, use the same word here. Pause the recording here.*

Paul talks about how **Satan** works in the hearts of those who refuse to obey God. Devil or Satan is discussed in the Master Glossary.

*Stop here and decide if you are going to use the name* ***Satan*** *or* ***Devil*** *or if you are going to use the name that Paul uses. Paul calls him the "ruler of the powers of the air" or the "prince of the powers of the air." If you use the title Paul uses, how can you make it clear that you are talking about Satan? You may use the title that you have used in other translations for Satan. Pause the audio here.*

Satan is a **spirit**. Spirit is discussed in the Master Glossary. God created the spirits but we cannot see this spirit. Satan and the evil spirits rebelled against God.

*Stop here and discuss the word for* ***spirit*** *that you will use here. It can be the same word that you have used for spirit in other translations so long as people understand that here the word is talking about a supernatural being. Pause the recording here.*

**Sin nature**, or sinful nature, means the attitudes and desires that you were born with. This sinful nature leads us to disobey God. Everyone has this sinful nature.

*Stop here and discuss the following question. How will you describe this* ***sinful nature****? Pause the recording here.*

Because of the way we act, or our nature, we deserve for God to show his **wrath** to us. Wrath is the emotion that God has when God sees sin and evil. God is holy and just. Wrath is stronger than anger, and it involves punishing people for their sin. However, whenever God shows his wrath, he always shows his mercy, especially when God deals with his chosen people.

*Stop here and discuss what word you will use for* ***wrath****.* *Wrath* *is discussed in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.*

**God** shows us **mercy**, or his great kindness.

*Stop here and discuss what word you will use for* ***mercy****.* *Mercy* *is discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same word for mercy you have used in previous books of the Bible. Pause this audio here.*

God's **grace** means that God has given you something you don't deserve. Grace is discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same word for grace that you have used in other passages.

**Heavenly realms**, or heavenly places, means the place where God lives and rules. Heaven is discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same word for heaven that you have used in previous passages.

God saved us by God's grace when we believed. This means that you did nothing to earn this. You can't say that God saved you because of your good works. Often when we talk about being saved, we use the word salvation. **Salvation** means that you have been rescued from a difficult situation. Salvation is discussed in the Master Glossary. If you use the word for salvation in your translation, use the same word for salvation that you have used in previous passages.

We are God's **workmanship**, masterpiece, or handiwork. All these words mean that God has made us. God has given us new life. We used to be spiritually dead, but God has created us anew. God is the one who has done this work in us. God did this so that we can do the good things God planned for us to do.

Speaking the Word
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of the passage in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this session, retell the passage, as a group, in your own language.

First, the whole group should practice telling the passage in your own language. Remember to include the things you decided in previous steps, like chronology, words, phrases, emotions, or anything else you discussed.

One group member should tell a few sentences of the passage and pause. Another group member should tell the next part of the passage and pause. Do this until the group has retold the whole passage. The group members can correct each other in this step. Pause this audio here.

Next, each member of the group should tell the whole passage without interruption at least one time. A group member can use random objects, motions, or their storyboard to help them remember the passage. Pause this audio here.

Next, the group can decide whose version of the passage you like the most. You may decide that you liked the way one group member told one scene but you liked the way a different group member told another scene. Pause this audio here.

Finally, the group can put together a final version of the passage that everyone agrees on. Each group member should practice telling this final version of the passage.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 2:11–18 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Paul has been telling the Gentile and Jewish believers that it is God's grace that saves them. Now, in this passage, Paul focuses on the peace that Jesus has brought between the two groups.

In the past the Jews had privileges with God that the Gentiles didn't have. Now God has brought the Jewish believers in Jesus together with the Gentile believers in Jesus and erased those differences. Because of God's actions, the two groups are at peace with each other and with God.

Paul starts by reminding the Gentiles of how they were once separated from God. Paul talks about circumcision, which was the sign of the covenant that God made with Abraham, the first and main ancestor of the Jewish people. When Abraham was an old man, God made a promise with Abraham that he would make Abraham's descendants into a special nation of people who would be dedicated to God. God promised to always be with his people, and his people promised to obey God. God asked Abraham and his male descendants to circumcise themselves as a sign of this special covenant with God. Circumcision was when the Jewish people cut off the loose skin of the boys' penis. The Jewish people circumcised every Jewish male just after they were born. Although some other ancient cultures also practiced circumcision, the Jews were especially proud of this symbol and the covenant that they had with God.

Gentiles were not circumcised, so they were not part of this covenant with God. They were considered outsiders. The Jews even spoke of the Gentiles in a negative way and called them the "uncircumcised." Paul continues reminding the Gentiles of how life was in the past. Paul reminds them that Jewish circumcision only affected the physical bodies of the Jewish men. This circumcision or sign of their covenant with God did not change their hearts, or make their relationship with others good.

*Stop here and discuss this question as a group. Tell a story about a group of people that you consider to be outsiders or not belonging to your group. Listen to how the storyteller describes the group. Now, as a group, talk about how you feel about these outsiders. What happens in your area when the outsiders get the same privileges as the local people? Pause this audio here.*

Paul then continues talking about the Gentiles and their lack of a relationship with God before they knew about Christ. Gentiles were not allowed to be citizens of Israel. Gentiles did not know about the covenant that God had with the Israelites. The Gentiles did not know about the promises that God had made to the Jewish people. The Gentiles didn't know God. The Gentiles lived in a world with no hope, which meant that they had no expectation of a future life with God after death.

Now Paul tells the Gentiles the good news! Before, the Gentiles were far away from Christ because they didn't know him. But then Christ died. Christ's blood from his death was a sacrifice just like the sacrifices of animals that the Jewish people made so that God would forgive their sins. Christ's sacrifice made it possible for both the Gentiles and the Jews to have a relationship with God, or to come close to God. When the Gentiles chose to believe in Christ Jesus, they accepted that Christ was their sacrifice, and God forgave their sins. Now the Gentiles can come close to God, or have a relationship with God!

*Stop and discuss the following question. Tell a story of a time when you were accepted into a group of people and felt like you belonged to the group. How did you feel? Then discuss as a group, what do people do when they are united in Christ? Pause the audio here.*

Then Paul begins to explain how Jesus Christ has changed the lives of the Gentiles and the Jews, and how Jesus has changed the relationship between the Gentiles and the Jews. Paul includes himself and the Jewish believers in this explanation. Paul says that the Gentiles and Jews who used to be separate groups are now one group. Paul uses a word picture of a wall or barrier that keeps two groups of people away from each other. This is a real wall that the people could see either in their homes or on their farms. Paul is comparing the bad feelings that the Gentiles and the Jews had always felt for each other with a wall. Paul is saying that the religious rules and laws that separated the Jews and the Gentiles were also like a wall between them. Those laws were the special laws that the Jews followed and made them think they were better than others. Circumcision is an example of one of these rules. When Jesus died it was like he broke this separating wall down and took it away. This means that Jesus took away those special rules and laws that the Jews had to follow. Now there is nothing to keep the two groups apart. So now the two groups of people are one group. Because now there is only one group, they can come near to God. Paul wants the two groups to see how, before, they were divided by that wall of bad feelings.

*Stop here and look at a picture of a wall or barrier that divides people or property. Discuss a time that you saw a barrier between different people groups or groups of people. What were the differences in the groups that made the barrier? What do people do to cause hostility or make bad attitudes between people groups? Pause the audio here.*

The Gentiles were far from God because they didn't even know him. The Jews were near to God because they were God's special people. But then Jesus came, and he told them that they could all have true peace with God because of what Jesus had done by dying. Jesus also told them that they could have peace with each other and be one special people group for God together! How could they do this? Jesus died for everyone, and when people believe that, the Holy Spirit brings them to God the Father. Now, both Jews and Gentiles are one people group\-and both can have a relationship with our Father God!

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 2:11–18 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has 2 parts.

**In the first part:** Paul reminds the Gentiles of the rules that separated them from the Jews before they became believers. God has taken away the rules that kept the two groups separated. Now the Gentiles can come to God and belong to God's people because Jesus died for them too.

**In the second part:** Paul describes how Jesus brings peace and unity between the Gentiles and the Jews. These two groups are now one people. Jesus has ended the system of laws that separated these two groups. Jesus has made peace between the two groups. Because of what Jesus has done, the Jews and Gentiles now have equal access to God through the Holy Spirit.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* God, who inspires Paul to write the letter
* Jesus
* The Holy Spirit
* Jews
* Gentiles

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In the first part of this passage, Paul reviews for the Gentiles what their lives were like before they became followers of Jesus Christ. According to Jewish law, someone was born a Gentile or a Jew. In other words, you inherited your status from your parents. Jewish parents circumcised their boys and Gentile parents did not. Now Paul lists the things that the Gentiles did not have, in contrast to the Jews, because they were not circumcised, or part of God's special people group. Circumcision was the sign of the covenant that the Jews had with God. Therefore, the Gentiles were excluded from this covenant. The Gentiles didn't know about the promises that God had made to the Jews. The Gentiles were not citizens of Israel. The Gentiles lived without God and without hope of a future life with God. All these things made the Gentiles far from God. But now that they are believers, everything has changed. The blood of Christ has brought the Gentiles near to God just like the Jews were near to God.

In the second part of this passage, Paul talks about how Jesus has brought peace to the Jews and the Gentiles. Before, there was a dividing wall of hostility between the two groups. This means that the two groups felt like they were enemies. Jesus broke down this wall of hostility.

Jesus ended the system of laws and regulations that separated the Jews and the Gentiles. Jesus made peace between the two groups. Jesus did this by uniting the two groups into one group. Then taking this one group, Jesus brought both groups into a good relationship with God. Jesus did this by dying on the cross. Jesus destroyed the wall of hostility between the two groups, meaning that he brought the two groups together.

*Stop here and discuss this wall of hostility that divides two people groups. How will you describe this wall of hostility so that your people will understand this? How will you describe how Jesus made one people group out of two people groups? Pause this audio here.*

Jesus brought peace to the Gentiles who were far from God because they were not part of God's people. Jesus brought peace to the Jews who were near to God because they were God's special people. You may need to make it clear in your translation why the Gentiles were far away and why the Jews were not far away from God. Both groups, now one group, can go to God the Father through the one Spirit\-the Holy Spirit. Remember that these two groups are the Jewish people and the non\-Jewish people. Now, the group that the two groups make together are one kind of group. Jesus made it possible for two very different groups to come together into one group.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. Select people or objects to represent each character.

*Show which people are Gentiles and which people are Jews. The Gentiles should be outside the group of Jews. Before believing in Jesus, the Gentiles were outsiders. When Paul talks about the covenant, or his promise with the Jews, God should be with the Jews. Have the Gentiles move so that they are far from God. Then when Paul says that the Gentiles have now been united with Jesus Christ, have the Gentiles and Jesus move so that they are standing together. Then when Paul says that the blood of Jesus has brought the Gentiles close to God, have the Gentiles move next to God. However, the Gentiles and Jews should still be separate from each other.*

In the second part of this passage, Paul talks about the wall of hostility between the Jews and Gentiles. Have the Jews and Gentiles stand in separate groups and look at each other with anger and hostility. It would be good to put something as a barrier or wall between the two groups. Then when Paul talks about the wall being broken, move the barrier away so that the two groups can move together. As Paul says Jesus Christ created one new people, have the Jews and Gentiles move together to form one people. As Paul explains how Christ has reconciled or brought the two groups together to God, have Christ act out what he does to bring them together. Now the hostility between the two groups has gone. As Paul says this, the two groups having now formed one group should show in culturally appropriate ways that they love each other and are one group.

Paul finishes by pointing to the Holy Spirit and says that the Holy Spirit leads us all to God because of what Jesus has done for us. Have the Holy Spirit lead the whole group to God.

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 2:11–18 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has 2 scenes.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* God who inspires Paul to write the letter
* Jesus
* The Holy Spirit
* Jews
* Gentiles

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

*Pause this audio here and act out the passage.*

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

*Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.*

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

In scene one, Paul reminds the Gentiles that they used to be outsiders or separated from the Jews and from God. Paul explains that the Jews called the Gentiles the uncircumcised because the Gentiles did not know about the covenant relationship that the Jews had with God. The Gentiles did not know about the covenant promises that God had made to the Jews. The Gentiles lived in a world without God. The Gentiles had no hope. But then the Gentiles heard about and believed in Jesus. Now that they believe, they have been united with Jesus. The blood of Jesus Christ has brought the Gentiles near to God.

*Pause the drama.*

Ask the Gentiles, "How do you feel when you remember what life was like for you before you believed in Jesus?" You may hear, "That feels so strange and far away. I'm so glad we aren't living like that anymore. It's true, we didn't know anything about the covenant promises or how to have a relationship with God. That makes me sad for all those people who still don't know these things. But for me, I'm so glad that Jesus has made me one with the Jews and that God sees me as one of His own. We are not different. We are one people\-God's people. I think it's important for all of us to know these things because people come here and try to tell us things that aren't true. They try to tell us that the Jews must not associate with us Gentiles. From what Paul is saying, we know how to answer those people now." \[!end] Continue the drama.

In scene two, Paul explains the wall of hostility that used to exist between the Jews and the Gentiles. Paul says that Jesus has broken down or destroyed this wall and made the Jews and Gentiles into one people. Jesus broke this wall by ending the system of the law that God had given the Jews. This law had many commandments and regulations.

*Pause the drama.*

Paul goes on to explain that Jesus brought peace to the Jews and the Gentiles by forming them into one group. They used to be two separate people groups. Now they are one people group. Both the Jews and the Gentiles who believe have been reconciled to God. Jesus accomplished this reconciliation by dying on the cross. As a result, all hostility between the two groups has gone. Now both groups have peace. Now both groups, through the Holy Spirit, can go to God, the Father. All this is because of what Jesus Christ did.

*Pause the drama.*

Ask the Gentile believers, "How do you feel when you hear Paul talking about you being joined as one group with the Jewish believers?" You may hear, "I love it that God considers me the same as them now. It was hard when I was trying to worship God but not allowed to eat with them or visit them. Now we are one family and I love it."

Ask the Jewish believers, "How do you feel when you hear Paul remind you that you are one group now?" You may hear, "Sometimes it is hard to forget the way life was. We always had to be separate, and sometimes I feel guilty when I don't keep separate from the Gentiles when eating or worshiping God. But I really like it when I can remember to put those feelings aside and just enjoy being together and worshiping God as one united people. I think it is right that Paul reminds us that God sees us as the same now."

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 2:11–18 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul says that the **Gentiles** were living apart from **Christ**. Gentiles are people who are not Jews. Although the word **Jews** is not mentioned in this passage, we know that the two groups Paul is talking about are the Gentiles and the Jews. You may make that clear if you need to.

*Stop here and discuss what words you will use for* ***Gentiles*** *and* ***Jews*** *if you decide to use the word Jews. Use the same words you have used in other books of the Bible.* *Gentiles* *and* *Jews* *are in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.*

Use the same word for Christ that you have been using. Christ is discussed in the Master Glossary.

Paul talks about **circumcision**. The Jewish people circumcised their male children, which means that they cut off the loose skin at the end of the boys' penis. This was a sign of the covenant relationship they had with God.

*Stop here and discuss what word you will use for* ***circumcision****.* *Circumcision* *is discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same word for circumcision that you have used in previous books of the Bible. Pause this audio here.*

Paul talks about how the Gentiles were not a part of the people of **Israel**, who are the Jews, or a part of the **covenant**, or strong promise, that God made between God and the Jews. The Gentiles were **foreigners**, or like outsiders from another country.

*Stop here and discuss what words you will use for* ***Israel****,* ***covenant****, and* ***foreigners****.* *Israel**,* *covenant**, and* *foreigners* *are discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same words for Israel, covenant, and foreigners that you have used in previous books of the Bible. Pause this audio here.*

Paul says that the Gentiles had no **hope**, or confident expectation, that they could belong to God. Use the same word for hope that you have used in previous passages, and remember that hope is in the Master Glossary.

Paul says that Jesus himself is our **peace**. Paul uses the word peace to mean unity and love for each other. This peace gives a fullness or completeness of life. Peace is discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same word for peace that you have used in previous passages.

Paul talks about a dividing wall. This would be a wall that divides the property of one person from the property of another person. After talking about the physical wall that divides property, Paul talks about the wall of hostility. This is an attitude.

*If needed, stop here and decide how you will describe the wall of hostility. Pause the audio here.*

Jesus brought peace, ending the system of the law with its commands and regulations. When Jesus came, he took away the need for the **law** from Moses that gave many commands and regulations that people had to follow. The law refers to the law that God gave Moses for his people many years before. That law included many commands, or rules that the people had to live by. There were regulations, or rules for how to live and worship God.

*Stop here and discuss how you will describe the* ***law*** *with its commands and regulations.* *Law* *and* *commandments* *are in the Master Glossary. Use the same words for law, commandments, and regulations that you have used in previous books of the Bible. Pause this audio here.*

Jesus brings us all to God by killing the hostility between the two groups through Jesus' death on the **cross**. Sometimes Paul just uses the word cross to mean Jesus' death.

*Stop here and discuss as a group how you will describe Jesus bringing people to God through the* ***cross****. You may say "through his death on the cross" if you need to. Use the same word for cross that you have used in previous books of the Bible, and remember that* *cross* *is in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.*

All of us come to God through the same **Holy Spirit**. Use the same words for Holy Spirit you have used in previous passages. Holy Spirit is discussed in the Master Glossary.

Speaking the Word
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of the passage in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this session, retell the passage, as a group, in your own language.

First, the whole group should practice telling the passage in your own language. Remember to include the things you decided in previous steps, like chronology, words, phrases, emotions, or anything else you discussed.

One group member should tell a few sentences of the passage and pause. Another group member should tell the next part of the passage and pause. Do this until the group has retold the whole passage. The group members can correct each other in this step. Pause this audio here.

Next, each member of the group should tell the whole passage without interruption at least one time. A group member can use random objects, motions, or their storyboard to help them remember the passage. Pause this audio here.

Next, the group can decide whose version of the passage you like the most. You may decide that you liked the way one group member told one scene but you liked the way a different group member told another scene. Pause this audio here.

Finally, the group can put together a final version of the passage that everyone agrees on. Each group member should practice telling this final version of the passage.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 2:19–22 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Paul has been telling the Ephesians that God has united the Gentiles and the Jews in Jesus Christ so that they have become one people group. Jesus broke down the barriers that used to exist between the Jews and Gentiles. Jesus made peace between the two groups. Everyone now has access to God through the Holy Spirit. Now, Paul gives three examples to explain how God has included the Gentiles. Paul talks about strangers and foreigners in a country. Then Paul talks about a family. Finally, Paul talks about a building.

Paul explains that the Gentiles are full citizens in God's kingdom; they are no longer strangers or foreigners. Foreigners are people from another tribe or country. Strangers are people who have moved to another country and live there all the time. These aliens or strangers have some rights, but they are not full citizens of the country where they live.

*Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do you treat foreigners and strangers in your country or area? Pause the audio here.*

Perhaps Paul was remembering how it was in the past when Gentiles went to the temple in Jerusalem to worship God. They were only allowed in certain parts of the temple because they were foreigners and not Jews. But Paul says that this difference has now been taken away. Earlier in this letter, Paul reminded the Gentiles that before they believed in Jesus, they were considered strangers, and they were not equal to the Jews. Now the Gentiles are equal to the Jews in God's eyes.

*Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How does someone become a citizen of your country? When a foreign\-born person becomes a citizen, how do the other citizens treat this person? What rights and privileges does the new citizen have? Pause the audio here.*

Paul's second example is that of family. At the beginning of the letter, Paul reminded the Ephesians that the Gentiles had been adopted into God's own family. Paul doesn't talk about adoption in this part of the letter, but Paul says here that the Gentiles are now full members of God's family, not just servants of the family. Gentiles and Jews are brothers and sisters together in the same family. The Gentile believers have the same rights and privileges as any children in a household. They are all God's children. When Paul talks like this, Paul is telling the Jewish believers that they must see the Gentile believers as their full brothers and sisters. Paul wants each group to see the other group as equal.

*Stop here and discuss how people adopt children in your culture. What rights and privileges do adopted children have? How does that compare to a child born into the family? Pause the audio here.*

Finally, Paul compares the believers to the way someone builds a house using stones. Paul is describing a particular type of house that people would build in the Middle East. The builders would dig a ditch which would be the outside edge of the house and fill this ditch with stones. These stones would be the foundation which is below the level of the ground. The people would build the wall on top of these foundation stones. The builder puts down the first big, square stone in a corner. This stone would become the cornerstone. Because the cornerstone is square, the builders place every other stone so that it lines up squarely with the cornerstone. The cornerstone is the most important stone in the building. With a good cornerstone and a good foundation, the building walls are strong and will last.

*Stop here and look at a picture of a stone foundation for a house. Identify the cornerstone. Pause the audio here.*

*Stop here and show a picture of the wall of the house that people are building with stone. Notice how the stones line up straight with the cornerstone. Pause the audio here.*

*Stop here and discuss the following question: How do you build houses in your culture? What do you build your houses with? What do you do to make your houses stand strong? Pause this audio here.*

Paul is saying to the Ephesians that they are like a house. Paul uses this example because everyone knew how to build a house out of stone. The first thing you put down is the cornerstone. Then you put down the foundation. Then you build the stone walls on the foundation. Paul says that Jesus is like the cornerstone. That means that everything must agree with Jesus and the teachings of Jesus. Then Paul says that the apostles and the prophets are like the foundation of the house. Perhaps this means that the apostles and the prophets carried God's message to the people, so what they taught is like the foundation of God's house. More likely, the work of the prophets, or people who taught the truth about Jesus, and the work of the apostles, or those whom Jesus sent to teach and start communities of believers, are the foundation on which believers build the church.

*Stop and discuss: Why do you think Paul said that the teachings of the apostles and prophets are like the foundation of a house? Why did Paul say that Jesus is like the cornerstone of a house? Pause this audio here.*

Then the believers, the Jews and the Gentiles, are God's family and are like the walls of the house. They have joined together to become a holy temple, or a special house, for the Lord God. Paul is using the image of the walls of a house to talk about how the believers join together to become a temple or house. The Lord is the highest ruler, or the master of the house. Paul repeats the teaching when Paul says that the believers are joined with Jesus Christ to form a temple with Jesus as the supreme ruler or leader of the temple. God lives in the temple. The Jewish believers already believed that God lived in the temple in Jerusalem. They went to Jerusalem to worship God. Now Paul tells them that God lives in each believer. God lives in each believer because God's Spirit lives in each believer. We can say that the believers themselves become the house for God's Spirit to live on the earth right now. Paul finishes this part of the letter by repeating to the Gentiles the good news that the Gentiles are also part of this house.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 2:19–22 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has 3 parts.

**In the first part:** Paul compares the Gentiles to strangers and foreigners. Paul says that the Gentiles are no longer like strangers and foreigners, but they are full citizens in God's Kingdom.

**In the second part:** Paul says the Gentiles are full members of God's family.

**In the third part:** Paul used the image of building a house of stones to represent the way that the Jews and Gentiles are united in Christ to be part of the house of God.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Foreigners and strangers
* Gentile believers
* Jewish believers
* Believing prophets
* Apostles
* Jesus
* God
* The Holy Spirit

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

*Stop here and talk about how you build a house in your community. How is this building similar or different to the way people built houses when Paul wrote the letter? If your building style is different, how will you describe a foundation and cornerstone so that your people understand these ideas? Look at the pictures of the cornerstone and foundation again if needed. Pause the audio here.*

*Stop here and practice building a small house, if this type of house is foreign to your culture. Collect some small boxes such as juice boxes to represent the stones. If you don't have juice boxes, find something else local that is small that you can use to build a wall. Then dig the ditch to put the foundation stones in place. Decide which one will be the cornerstone and put it at the corner. Then put others in place so that they are lined up with the cornerstone. Then using the pictures as a guide, build a wall. Notice that the wall lined up with the cornerstone is straight. Now describe what you have done. Pause the audio here.*

This passage has three parts. In the first part of this passage, Paul talks to the Gentile believers in Ephesus. Paul reminds the Gentiles that they are no longer strangers or foreigners. Instead, the Gentile believers are now citizens with the same rights and privileges as the Jewish believers.

*Stop here and discuss as a group: When you talk about people from another tribe or another country, how do you describe them? When you talk about people who have come to live in your country but have not become citizens of your country, how do you describe them? Pause the audio here.*

In the second part of this passage, Paul tells the Ephesian Gentiles that they are now members of God's household. A household included everyone who belonged to and lived in a house, including all the members of the family. Paul is saying that the Gentiles belong in God's family.

In the third part of this passage, Paul uses the image of building a house made of stone with a stone foundation to help the believers understand what has happened to them. Paul says that Jesus is like the cornerstone of the house because Jesus is what makes the teachings true and right. The teachings, or work of the prophets and the apostles, are like the foundation of the house because they keep the house stable. Then the Gentile believers are united with the Jewish believers, and they form the walls of the house. This special house becomes a holy temple, or a special home for God. God lives in this holy temple by God's Holy Spirit. God lives in each believer because God's Spirit lives in each believer. We can say that the believers themselves become the house for God's Spirit to live on the earth right now. Paul ends by reminding the Gentiles that they form part of this holy temple.

*Stop here and discuss as a group how you will describe the comparisons of Jesus being like the cornerstone of a house, the teachings of the apostles and prophets being like the foundation of a house, and the believers being like the walls of a house for God. Pause this audio here.*

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. Choose someone to be each of the characters. The Jewish and Gentile believers should be in two separate groups. As Paul tells what has happened to the Gentiles, have Paul point to the Gentiles. Paul should tell the Gentiles that they are no longer foreigners but full citizens of God's kingdom. The Gentiles should recognize that this is good news when they hear it.

Then Paul tells the Gentile believers that they are now members of God's family. Have the Gentile believers move to where the Jewish believers are standing. God should move to be with all of them and show them that each person is a part of the family and welcomed in the family.

Then Paul uses the word picture of building a house. As Paul talks about each section of the house as they are building it, have the characters move. Have Jesus move to be the cornerstone of the house. Then the prophets and apostles should move to line up squarely with Jesus to form the foundation. Then the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers should unite together to form the walls of the house. As the people move to build the wall, have Paul point to them to explain how the builder is carefully joining them together so that they form a holy temple. The Jewish believers should move together with the Gentile believers in such a way that you cannot tell that there is a difference between them. Then have the Holy Spirit move to live in the holy temple.

God's Holy Spirit lives in this temple, meaning that God's Holy Spirit lives inside the believers in him.

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 2:19–22 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has 3 parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Foreigners and strangers
* Gentile believers
* Jewish believers
* Believing prophets
* Apostles
* Jesus
* God
* The Holy Spirit

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

*Pause this audio here and act out the passage.*

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

*Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.*

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

In part one, Paul starts this passage by telling the Gentiles that they are no longer foreigners or aliens or strangers.

*Pause the drama.*

In part two, Paul says that the Gentiles are now members of God's family. The Gentiles have the same rights and privileges as the Jewish believers.

*Pause the drama.*

Ask Gentiles, "How do you feel when you hear that you are full citizens like the Jewish believers?" You may hear, "This is such good news. We have had people come here and tell us that we are not full citizens. I want to belong fully to God! Some of us have been to Jerusalem and we know how the Jews treat the Gentiles at the temple there. Paul is saying that when we meet here for worship and to eat together we are all the same. I love hearing that." \[!end] Continue the drama.

Then in part 3, Paul uses the image of building a stone house, a common building in the Middle East, to help the believers understand this important lesson. Paul tells them that Jesus is the cornerstone of the building. Then Paul says that the teachings of the prophets and the teachings of the apostles are the foundation of the house.

*Pause the drama.*

Ask the prophets and the apostles, "How do you feel when you hear that your teachings and your work are the foundation of God's holy temple?" You may hear, "I said everything that God told me to say. I warned the people to follow what God says." Or, "I've tried to teach these people all that Jesus taught me. I've tried to make sure that they know what it means to follow Jesus. These teachings should be the foundation or basis of their whole lives." Or, "Sometimes I feel so responsible to make sure that the believers understand everything God has said. It helps me feel better when I hear what Paul teaches." \[!end] Continue the drama.

Paul tells the Gentile believers and the Jewish believers that God has united them so that they can form the walls of the temple. This temple will be a holy place, a place where God lives by his Holy Spirit. The Gentiles are also part of these walls which make the House for God

*Pause the drama.*

Ask the Gentile believers, "How do you feel knowing that you are part of God's holy temple?" You may hear, "I like hearing this. It seems like it is important that I am part of the building of this temple. If I'm not part of it, then the wall won't be as strong as it should be. That makes me feel good. I love knowing that I'm equal to the other believers in God's eyes."

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 2:19–22 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Although the word **Gentile** isn't in this passage, Paul talks directly to the Gentiles who are like strangers and foreigners. Some translations use the word Gentile to make sure that everyone knows that Paul is talking to the Gentiles. If you use the word Gentile, be sure to use the same word for Gentile that you have used in previous translations. Gentiles is in the Master Glossary.

**Foreigner** means people of another tribe or country. Strangers or sojourners are people who have moved to another country and live there all the time. These aliens or strangers may have some rights but they are not full citizens of the country where they live.

*Stop here and discuss the best word to use for* ***foreigner*** *and the best word to use for stranger, or* ***sojourner****. Both* *foreigner* *and* *sojourner* *are in the Master Glossary. If you have translated these words in another book of the Bible, use the same words here. Pause the audio here.*

God says that the Gentiles are now **saints**, or God's **holy** people. Any person dedicated to God is considered to be holy. Saints means holy people. The word saint and the word holy are in the Master Glossary. Use the same word for saints or holy people that you have been using.

The Gentiles are members of God's **household**. All the people living together in a house make up a household.

*Stop here and discuss what word you will use for* ***household****. Use the same word you have used in other books of the Bible, and remember that* *household* *is in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.*

Paul says that God builds his people on the **foundation**, or base, of the house. The foundation must be square with a cornerstone. A good house is built on a solid foundation. Use the word you have decided to use to describe the foundation of the house.

**Christ** Jesus is the cornerstone of the house. Use the same word for Christ that you have been using, and remember that Christ is in the Master Glossary. **Cornerstone** is the first stone laid in a foundation. The cornerstone must be square. Every part of the foundation must line up with the cornerstone so that the entire house has straight walls. The cornerstone is the most important stone.

*If needed, stop here again and discuss as a group how you will describe the* ***foundation*** *and* ***cornerstone*** *of a house in your translation.* *Cornerstone* *is in the Master Glossary. If you have translated these words in another book of the Bible, use the same words here. Pause this audio here.*

The foundation of the house is the **apostles** and **prophets**. In this passage, the prophets were the people of that time who gave God's message to the believers.

*If needed, stop here and discuss what words you will use for* ***apostles*** *and* ***prophets****. Use the same word for apostle you used earlier in Ephesians, and the same word for prophets that you used in other books of the Bible.* *Apostles* *and* *prophets* *are discussed in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.*

Paul says that the believers become the walls of a holy **temple**, or God's House. Temple is the same word as the temple in Jerusalem where the Jews worshiped God.

*Stop here and review as a group what word you use for* ***temple****. Use the same word you have used previously, and remember that* *temple* *is discussed in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.*

**Lord** refers to the master of the house or the supreme ruler. Here, the word Lord probably refers to God. God joins us together with Jesus and it is like we are becoming a holy temple dedicated to God. However, this word, Lord, could also refer to Jesus. Lord is discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same word for Lord as you have been using.

God lives in the temple by His **Spirit**. The Holy Spirit is discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same word for Holy Spirit you have been using.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 3:1–6 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Paul continues his letter to the Ephesians. As Paul starts this part of the letter, Paul begins a prayer. But just as Paul begins to pray, he thinks of some other things he wants to say and begins to explain those things instead. Paul stops his prayer and takes the time to explain to the Ephesian believers the special work that God has been telling him to do. In a later part of this letter, Paul will return to his prayer and finish it.

Paul starts this section by reminding the Ephesians that Paul is the person writing to them. Then Paul reminds the Gentiles that Paul is in prison. Paul says, "I am a prisoner because I was serving Jesus Christ by telling you, the Gentiles, the good news about Jesus." Paul is in prison in Rome. Paul was arrested when Paul went to Jerusalem after his last visit to Ephesus. Some Jews, knowing that Paul worked with the Gentiles, thought that Paul had taken a Gentile into a part of the temple where the Gentiles were not allowed to go. Paul did not do that. But because the Jews thought he did, the Jews tried to kill Paul. Paul was arrested by Roman soldiers. Eventually, the Roman government sent Paul to Rome for a trial. Paul is writing this letter to the Ephesians while he is waiting for that trial.

Paul starts praying for the Ephesian believers, but then suddenly Paul changes the subject so that he can explain more about his special role. Paul is certain that the Ephesian believers have heard about Paul's special ministry to the Gentiles. It is like God made Paul a steward for the Gentiles. A steward is a person who works for someone and handles all the responsibilities of business for that person. For example, maybe the steward works for a man who has a lot of land and property. The steward directs or manages all the other servants. The steward is in charge of the daily activities of the business. Paul says that he is a steward of the grace of God. This means that God has assigned Paul to take care of the gospel, or the good news about Jesus Christ, and Paul is working to do exactly what God has assigned him to do. Paul says that God has trusted him, Paul, to do this work. This work is to tell the Gentiles about God's grace. God's grace is that we do not deserve and did not earn God's love and salvation. We find God's grace in the good news about Jesus, because God sent Jesus to die to free us and give us eternal life with God, even though we did not deserve it.

*Stop here and discuss the following question. Tell a story about someone with a large amount of property and business. Someone takes care of the land or business for the owner. The owner trusts this person who takes care of the house, property, and servants. Listen to how the storyteller describes this person and his work. Pause the audio here.*

Paul tells the Ephesians that he has already written to them about his special role, which is the role of telling the Gentiles about the mystery of the grace of Christ. We do not know, but maybe this means that Paul wrote another letter before this letter and that letter has been lost. Or maybe Paul is referring to what he has already written in this letter to the Ephesians. In any case, Paul is reminding the Ephesian believers that God revealed to Paul a special revelation\-God revealed to Paul the "mystery of Christ." Before Jesus, there were things that people did not know about how to get close to God, but now that Jesus has come, people know how to get close to God. Paul encourages the Ephesian believers to continue reading this letter so that they can understand how special this revelation is. For many generations before this, people did not understand or know who Jesus was. But now God has caused the Holy Spirit to reveal this plan to the people that God chose as His sent ones or spokesmen. These people God has sent are the holy, or set apart, apostles and the holy prophets. Paul is one of these special people that God sent to tell the Gentiles this good news.

After all this explanation, Paul reveals the mystery\-this thing that no one has understood before. Paul uses the same comparisons here to describe this mystery that he used earlier in this letter\-the comparisons of family inheritance and human bodies. Paul has already been telling the Ephesians that they are one family and have one inheritance as children of God. The Jewish people are the nation of Israel. God made a covenant many years ago with Israel that he would give them an inheritance\-that God would be with them forever. Now Paul reminds the believers again that the Gentiles who believe in Jesus as their savior will have the same inheritance from God as the Jewish people. Paul has been telling the Ephesian believers that the Jewish believers and Gentile believers are like one human body. Now he tells them again that together, the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers make up a unified body of people that works together like one human body. Paul reminds the believers that Christ promises eternal life with God forever, and both the Jews and the Gentiles will share in the benefits of Christ Jesus' promise to save them.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 3:1–6 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has 2 parts.

**In the first part:** Paul begins to pray. But just after reminding the Ephesians of who he is and where he is, Paul interrupts his praying.

**In the second part:** Paul explains more to the Ephesians about the mystery, or secret plan, that God has revealed to Paul. This plan is that the Gentiles who follow Jesus will also receive the promises that God has already given to the Jews. Paul explains that God used His Holy Spirit to make this revelation.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* A scribe or secretary that writes down what Paul says
* God
* Jesus Christ
* The Holy Spirit
* Gentile believers
* Jewish believers
* Apostles and prophets
* Previous generations

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In the first part of this passage, Paul begins this passage by telling the Ephesians that all the good news he has just told them makes him want to pray for them! Paul says, "For this reason, I want to pray..." but Paul interrupts himself before he tells them he is going to pray. Paul reminds the Ephesians of who he is and where he is. He says, "I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus." Paul strongly emphasizes that Paul is the one writing the letter. It's as if Paul wants the people listening to the letter to think that Paul is the one reading it to them.

*Stop here and tell a story about someone who writes an important letter or sends an important message to some people. In your culture, how does this person make it clear that the message is from this person and not someone else? Pause the recording here.*

The Ephesian believers would know all about the reasons why Paul is in prison. Paul does not re\-tell them all this. When Paul says he is a prisoner of Christ Jesus, Paul means he is in prison because he follows Christ's teachings and commandments. Jesus did not put Paul in prison\-the Roman government put Paul in prison. Then Paul changes the subject. It's as if Paul suddenly thinks of something else he needs to say before continuing his prayer.

*Stop here and discuss the following question. Have someone tell a story or begin to introduce a subject. Immediately the storyteller thinks of some other things he needs to say and stops the story to explain those things. Listen to the storyteller and then talk about how the storyteller changed his way of talking so that the listeners know that he is now explaining something different. Pause the audio here.*

In the second part of this passage, Paul explains that God has made Paul a steward of God's grace. This means that Paul has been given special responsibilities to help the Gentiles understand and receive God's grace: God's love that we don't deserve. Another way to say this is, "God showed His kindness when God chose me to help you."

*Stop here and discuss as a group: How will you talk about Paul's role as a steward of God's grace? Pause this audio here.*

Paul tells the Ephesians that God has revealed God's secret plan to Paul. This revelation is new. Previous generations didn't know or understand this mystery or secret. Now God has revealed this secret plan to God's holy apostles and holy prophets. God used his Holy Spirit to reveal this plan.

Then Paul tells the Ephesians what this secret plan is that God has revealed. The plan is that the Gentile believers and the Jewish believers are both able to inherit eternal life from God. They can inherit this life because of the good news about Jesus, or the gospel. Then Paul uses 3 different comparisons to describe this new relationship between the Jewish believers and Gentile believers. Firstly, Paul says that anyone, even a Gentile, who has believed the good news about Jesus is now a child of God. They are equal in God's eyes and therefore receive the same inheritance or gifts from God. Secondly, Paul says the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers form one body, like one human body that works together in unity. The third idea is that both Jewish believers and Gentile believers will receive the promise that they can have eternal life with God forever when they follow Jesus.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. Select people or objects to represent each of the characters. The Gentile believers in Ephesus, the Jewish believers in Ephesus, and people from previous generations can gather in three separate groups. As the passage starts, show God revealing his mystery to Paul and the apostles and prophets that God has set apart especially to share his good news. The Holy Spirit can move from God to Paul, to the apostles and the prophets and explain the mystery to them. Then Paul goes to prison and begins to dictate a letter to a scribe. Show that as Paul begins to pray to God, he interrupts himself and the scribe has to change what he is writing.

Now Paul turns to the Gentile believers. Paul says, "You know that God made me the steward of God's grace towards the Gentiles." The Gentiles, the Jews, and the people in other generations will look confused because they don't know what this special or secret plan is.

Then Paul explains the plan to the Gentile believers. As Paul explains that the Gentiles will inherit God's promises just like the Jews, move the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers together to form one group. They are now one body or group of people. God gives all of the believers in this one big group his good gifts. Have Jesus hand each person the same gift or inheritance or blessing. Have the believers look at their gifts and realize that both groups are receiving exactly the same thing.

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 3:1–6 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has 2 parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Scribe or secretary who writes what Paul says
* God
* Jesus Christ
* The Holy Spirit
* Gentile believers
* Jewish believers
* Apostles and prophets
* Previous generations

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

*Pause this audio here and act out the passage.*

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

*Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.*

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

In part 1, Paul starts to say that because of the good news he has just written to them, he wants to pray.

Then in part 2, Paul interrupts his prayer to explain more to the Ephesians. Paul reminds the Ephesians that Paul is a prisoner because he was taking the gospel to the Gentiles.

*Pause the drama.*

Ask the Ephesian Gentile believers, "How do you feel when you hear that Paul is in prison because Paul told the Gentiles about Jesus?" You may hear, "I am so grateful that Paul came here and told us about Jesus. I know that Paul is in prison because of his love for us, and I am sad for him. Knowing what this has cost Paul, I think I should listen even more carefully to what Paul is telling us. It is important enough that Paul was willing to risk going to prison and suffering, so it is also important that I listen and follow." \[!end] Continue the drama.

Paul begins to talk directly to the Gentiles. Paul tells them that God gave Paul special responsibilities to explain to the Gentiles about God's grace.

*Pause the drama.*

Paul goes on to explain that God has revealed His secret plan through the Holy Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets. They now know the secret, but previous generations didn't know the secret.

*Pause the drama.*

Then Paul explains the secret, or mystery, that God has revealed. This secret is that the Gentile believers are part of God's family. The Gentile believers are God's children just like the Jewish believers. The two groups now form one family. The Gentile believers will inherit God's gifts in the same way as the Jewish believers. There will be no difference in the inheritance. Because both groups belong to Jesus Christ, they are God's children and God considers them the same.

*Pause the drama.*

Ask the Gentile believers, "How do you feel when you hear that you will inherit the same things as the Jewish believers will?" You may hear, "This is such good news. I've wanted to be one family with them for a long time but there was always that separation because I didn't follow the same religious laws. I knew I couldn't fully participate with them even when I believed in God. But now, we all understand that believing is all that is required and we are now brothers and sisters because we believe. Just like any family, we all inherit equally. I'm so glad to know this. I'm so glad I can meet with them, eat with them and we can pray together."

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 3:1–6 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul says he is a **prisoner** of **Christ** Jesus for the sake of the **Gentiles**. Paul means that he is in prison in Rome because he was telling the Gentiles about Jesus. The word prisoner here means someone who is in jail or prison. Christ and Gentiles are discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same words for Christ and Gentiles that you have been using.

Paul says that God gave Paul the **stewardship** of God's grace or special responsibilities. A steward is a person who takes care of the daily routine of a house or business. A steward pays the rents and salaries, hires people and generally makes sure that all runs well. Stewardship means that the person is doing the things that a steward should do. Some translations talk about stewardship and other translations talk about "special responsibilities."

*If needed, stop here and discuss as a group how you will translate the idea of stewardship or special responsibilities that God has given Paul. Pause this audio here.*

Paul has the responsibility of telling the Gentiles that God's **grace**, or undeserved love, is for them also. Grace is discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same word for grace that you have been using.

Paul says that God has revealed the **mystery** of Christ to Paul. The mystery of Christ means God's secret plan or hidden plan for the Gentiles. When Paul is talking about a mystery, he is talking about a divine secret that God is now revealing to people. God makes this secret or mystery known to people through the Holy Spirit. Paul explains that this mystery of Christ is that the Jewish believers and Gentile believers are now the joint **heirs** or co\-heirs of the promises that God has made. They will both receive the promises from God. The Jews and the Gentiles are now one body in Christ. The new life in Christ is now available to anyone who believes in Jesus.

*Stop here and discuss as a group what word you will use for* ***heir****. See the Master Glossary for more information about* *heirs**, and translate this word in the same way you have in previous books of the Bible. Pause this audio here.*

*Stop here and discuss as a group: How will you talk about the "mystery of Christ" in your translation? Pause this audio here.*

This mystery was not revealed to other **generations**. Generations are the group of people who were living at the same time. Paul is saying that people who lived before this time did not know about the mystery.

*Stop here and discuss as a group: How will you talk about the other generations of people?* *Generations* *is in the Master Glossary. Use the same word for generations that you have used in other books of the Bible. Pause this audio here.*

God has revealed this plan through the Spirit. Spirit refers to the **Holy Spirit**, or God's Spirit. God revealed his plan to the Holy Spirit, or by using the Holy Spirit, to his special apostles and prophets. Holy Spirit is discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same term for Holy Spirit that you have been using.

God has revealed this plan to the **holy** **apostles** and **prophets**. The word holy applies to both the apostles and the prophets, because both are set apart for God's work. Apostles, prophet, and holy are all discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same word for apostle, prophet, and holy that you have been using.

The Holy Spirit revealed that the mystery is that the **gospel**, or **good news**, is also for the Gentiles, not just for **Israel**! And now the Gentiles also inherit eternal life with God forever! Use the same word for Israel and good news or gospel that you used in previous passages, and remember that Israel and good news or gospel are in the Master Glossary.

Speaking the Word
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of the passage in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 3:7–13 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Paul started the previous passage with a prayer. Then Paul interrupted himself to explain more about how the Gentiles and Jews who believe in Jesus are equal members of God's family. Now Paul continues his explanations by focusing on what God has told Paul to do.

Paul starts this explanation by saying that God has made Paul a servant of the gospel. This means that God has given Paul a job to do. Paul's job is to announce or tell others the good news. Paul sees this job from God as wonderful and special. God's Spirit, which is also God's power, gives Paul God's grace or undeserved love so that Paul can do this special work for God. Paul recognizes that God has been loving and compassionate towards him. Long ago, Paul used to be an enemy of God and God's people, and that's why he calls himself the "least deserving of all of God's special people, or saints." Paul always felt that he, Paul, shouldn't be called an apostle like the others who had worked with Jesus during the years that Jesus was on the earth. Paul says that because God showed grace to Paul, God has allowed Paul to become one of the apostles. God called Paul to do this job even though Paul didn't deserve it.

God gave Paul this special job or responsibility. This special job was to tell the Gentiles about the good things that Jesus gives. These good things can be called endless treasures. A treasure is something very special or things that are really valuable. An endless treasure is like riches or blessings that we can't count or measure because they keep coming and never stop. There is no end to the treasure.

*Stop here and discuss as a group: Tell a story about something so good that you just want to keep talking about it. What kinds of things do you consider to be wonderful treasures from God? Pause this audio here.*

Then Paul says, "God chose me to explain to everyone everywhere how God will make his secret plan, or mystery, happen." God is the creator of all things. And God has kept his plan a secret, or hidden in God. God has not revealed this plan to anyone until now when God has revealed the plan to Paul. Now, God wants Paul to explain this special, hidden plan to everyone.

The plan is that the church, or all believers in Jesus, will show others how God plans to bring people together. God has many types of wisdom. God has a purpose in mind. God uses the church to reveal or show all His wisdom to the spiritual powers and rulers or the rulers in heavenly places. These are the spirit beings who have authority or rule in the places where we can't see them. This means that both the angels and the evil spirits will see God's wisdom through the way God works in the church. God has planned to reveal His wisdom like this since before God created the universe. This has always been God's plan. And God has done this through Jesus Christ our Lord, or master. Because of what Jesus Christ our master did through dying on the cross and being raised again, God has done what God always planned to do.

Then Paul has some wonderful news. Paul reminds us that we believe in Jesus Christ and we are united with Jesus because of this belief or faith. Then Paul says that because Christ gives us courage and confidence, we can come into the presence of God without being afraid.

Finally, Paul talks about his personal situation. Paul refers back to the beginning of this section where Paul begins to pray and then cuts off his prayer to remind the Ephesians that he is in prison. Paul tells the Ephesians that they should not be discouraged when they hear about Paul's sufferings in prison. Paul has these trials or sufferings because Paul has been preaching the gospel, or good news, to the Gentiles. Paul specifically tells the Ephesians not to feel discouraged. Paul wants the Ephesians to feel honored by Paul's sufferings. Paul wants the Ephesian believers to be proud of Paul's sufferings for their sake, or to feel honor because Paul is suffering for them.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 3:7–13 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has 3 parts.

**In the first part:** Paul tells the Ephesians that God has given Paul the gift of his grace, or undeserved love. This grace makes Paul able to serve God and preach the wonderful news about Jesus to the Gentiles.

**In the second part:** Paul tells the Ephesians that God wants His church to show God's wisdom and truth about Jesus to all the spiritual world. This truth is that we can freely get close to God.

**In the third part:** Paul who is in prison tells the Ephesians to feel honored that Paul is suffering for their sake.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* God
* Jesus Christ
* The Holy Spirit
* Gentile believers
* Jewish believers
* Unseen spirits and rulers or angels

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In the first part of this passage, Paul explains to the Ephesians how God has chosen Paul and has given Paul a gift so that Paul can serve God by spreading the news to others. This gift is probably God's grace.

Paul uses language that shows that Paul loves the task of sharing the good news. However, Paul considers himself to be unworthy of the task. Even so, God chose Paul to explain God's mysterious plan that God had kept secret until now. This mysterious plan is full of endless treasures, or good things from God.

*Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How will you talk about endless treasures from God? Pause this audio here.*

God has had this plan since he created the world, but God has not revealed the plan before until He told Paul about it.

In the second part of this passage, Paul goes on to say that God intends to use the church, or the community of believers, to show God's wisdom. God's wisdom is wonderful, deep, and rich. We cannot understand it. God is wise in everything he does.

*Stop here and discuss as a group: How will you talk about God's deep wisdom? How will you say that God is wise in everything he does? Pause this audio here.*

Everyone, including the unseen spirits and rulers in heavenly places, or supernatural spirit beings, will be able to see God's wisdom. Jesus Christ, our Lord, is the person who made God's eternal plan possible. God had this plan from the beginning of the world. Because of what Jesus did and because we trust and follow Jesus, all of us who believe can get close to God.

In the third part of this passage, Paul tells the Ephesians that they should not lose heart, or be discouraged when they think of Paul in prison and in chains. In Paul's time, people talked about their emotions being in their "heart." When people say that they lose heart, they are saying that they become discouraged. Paul says he is suffering because of his work with the Gentiles. Then Paul tells them to feel honored or encouraged when they hear about Paul's sufferings.

*Stop here and tell a story about a time when you or a group felt discouraged about something. Listen to the storyteller. Pay attention to the words they use to describe being discouraged. How will you talk about Paul encouraging the believers and telling them to not be discouraged? Pause the recording here.*

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. Assign someone to be each of the characters.

Show God giving Paul his gift of grace and his power. The Holy Spirit comes and gives Paul power. God tells Paul to be the person to spread the good news to the Gentiles. Paul feels that this assignment is a privilege, so the person playing Paul should show joy or gladness about the assignment that God has given to Paul. Then, Paul starts spreading the good news by going from one group of Gentiles to the next. As the Gentiles hear this, they are happy to learn this new thing!

Now have the groups of Gentiles form churches together with the Jewish believers. Jesus comes to these churches and shows them what to do. As they do these things together, show the unseen spirits and rulers watching and seeing God's wisdom in what the believers are doing. Jesus can show that he is bringing believers in Jesus to where God is. Show the believers moving towards God boldly and without any fear.

In the second part of this passage, Paul could show his chains or something that shows he has no freedom. He is in prison. Paul tells the believers not to be discouraged because of Paul's sufferings. Show the believers feeling honored that Paul is suffering for their sake.

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 3:7–13 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has 3 parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* God
* Jesus Christ
* The Holy Spirit
* Gentile believers
* Jewish believers
* Unseen spirits and rulers or angels

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

*Pause this audio here and act out the passage.*

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

*Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.*

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

In part one, Paul tells the Ephesians how God gave Paul the special assignment of spreading the good news about Jesus to others. Paul says that this assignment is a special privilege. Then Paul says that he is the least deserving, or the last person of all the believers that God could have chosen for this job.

*Pause the drama.*

Paul goes on to explain what the task was that God has given Paul. Paul's task is to tell the Gentiles about all the special treasures or riches they have in Jesus.

In part two, Paul also needed to explain the mysterious plan that God has had since creation but has kept secret. God's plan is to use the church, or the community of believers, to show God's wisdom to everyone including the spirit rulers, or the beings we can't see who rule the heavenly places.

*Pause the drama.*

Ask the Gentiles, "How do you feel when you hear that God's plan works through you and your fellow believers?" You may hear, "I am honored. God chose to reveal his plan through us. God wants people to see God's wisdom when they see the church. I hope that when people see us meeting together to worship God and study God's word, they will see God's wisdom showing in us. This is truly amazing!"

Ask Jesus, "How do you feel about this plan now?" You may hear, "I knew about the plan and I agreed to do my part of the plan. I knew it involved suffering physically. I'm glad that it was accomplished and as a result, people have come into a full relationship with God. Right now, I'm really happy that so many people are believing and following my teachings." \[!end] Continue the drama.

Paul continues to explain to the Ephesians that now, because of what Jesus did, they can come confidently into God's presence.

*Pause the drama.*

In part three, Paul reminds the Ephesians that Paul is in prison and suffering for their sake. He is in prison because he took the good news to the Gentiles. But Paul doesn't want them to feel discouraged or to worry about this. In fact, Paul wants the opposite. Paul wants them to feel honored when they hear that Paul is suffering for their sake.

*Pause the drama.*

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 3:7–13 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul says that God has given him God's **grace** and **power**. When people receive grace, they receive something good that they didn't earn and don't deserve. Use the same word for grace that you have been using. Grace is discussed in the Master Glossary. Power is a special strength that the Holy Spirit gives to people who believe in Jesus. When talking about God's power, use the same word that you have used in previous translations.

Paul says that God made Paul a **servant** or minister of the **gospel**. The word for servant is not the same word as slave. Paul serves others, or in this case Paul serves the gospel by telling others about Jesus. The gospel is the good news about Jesus and what Jesus has done for all of us. Use the same word for gospel that you have been using.

*Stop here and discuss what word you will use for* ***servant****. This is the kind of servant that serves others, often in the church. This is not a slave.* *Servant* *is discussed in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.*

Paul says that he is the least of God's people or the **saints**. At the time that Paul wrote this letter, a saint was anyone who believed in Jesus. All believers were saints. Saint is discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same word for saints that you have been using.

Paul was to explain the mysterious plan or the **mystery** of God's plan to the Gentiles. A mystery is something that we don't know or understand or can't easily understand. Use the same word you used in the previous passage for mystery.

God kept His plan **secret**, or hidden, from the beginning, or the time when God created everything. Something that is secret means that no one can speak about it and people cannot know about it. God kept it secret, or didn't tell anyone about it, until God revealed the plan to Paul and told Paul to tell the Gentiles about this plan. Paul talks about this plan as an eternal plan. That means that the plan had no beginning and has no end. The plan has always been with God.

God's purpose is to use the **church** to show God's **wisdom**. The church is made up of those who believe in Jesus and gather to worship together. The church is a group of people, not a building. Church and wisdom are discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same words for church and wisdom that you have been using.

The unseen rulers and authorities in the **heavenly** places, or heavenly realms, will see God's wisdom. Paul is talking about the spirit world, or where those spirits live that no one can see. These spirits can include both angels or good spirits who do the things God assigns them to do and evil spirits or those who work against God.

*Stop here and discuss the best way to talk about these spirits so that people understand that these may refer to both good and evil spirits. Remember to talk about heavenly places or heavenly realms in the same way you have in previous passages.* *Heaven* *is in the Master Glossary. Pause the audio here.*

God has carried out his eternal plan through Jesus **Christ** our **Lord**, or **master**. Jesus Christ is the term for Jesus. Christ and Lord are discussed in the Master Glossary. Use the same words for Christ and Lord you have been using.

Because of our **faith** in Jesus, we can come into God's presence. In this context, faith describes people who trust in what Jesus did for us. Use the same word for faith that you have been using. Faith is discussed in the Master Glossary.

Paul tells the Ephesians not to lose heart or not to feel **discouraged**. Use the expression you decided to use for being discouraged or feeling tired or losing heart.

Paul says that his sufferings are the Ephesian believers' **glory**. This means that Paul's sufferings are like an honor for the Ephesians. The Ephesians should feel honor or be proud because of Paul's sufferings. Paul is saying that this has happened for their benefit or to help them, and they should be proud of it. Use the same word for glory that you have used before, and remember that glory is discussed in the Master Glossary.

Speaking the Word
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of the passage in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this session, retell the passage, as a group, in your own language.

First, the whole group should practice telling the passage in your own language. Remember to include the things you decided in previous steps, like chronology, words, phrases, emotions, or anything else you discussed.

One group member should tell a few sentences of the passage and pause. Another group member should tell the next part of the passage and pause. Do this until the group has retold the whole passage. The group members can correct each other in this step. Pause this audio here.

Next, each member of the group should tell the whole passage without interruption at least one time. A group member can use random objects, motions, or their storyboard to help them remember the passage. Pause this audio here.

Next, the group can decide whose version of the passage you like the most. You may decide that you liked the way one group member told one scene but you liked the way a different group member told another scene. Pause this audio here.

Finally, the group can put together a final version of the passage that everyone agrees on. Each group member should practice telling this final version of the passage.

6. Who do you know who needs to hear this passage?

**This is the end of the recording.**

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 3:14–21 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In a previous passage, Paul began a prayer and then interrupted himself to give further explanation about God's plan. This plan was for the Gentiles and the Jews to share equally in the wonderful promises that God's children will inherit. Then Paul explained how God had chosen Paul to give this message to the Gentiles. Now Paul returns to his prayer.

Paul starts his prayer by making a statement that refers to all the good news that Paul has just told. \[The good news is for both the Jewish people and for the Gentiles \- that when people believe in Jesus they are able to come close to God.]{.mark} God has joined or united the Gentiles and the Jews into one group, the church. Now Paul now wants to offer a prayer for this group. Paul starts by saying that Paul is kneeling down to pray. Most Jews prayed while standing, but sometimes Jews knelt on the ground to show that they were really submitting to God and worshiping him. Paul chose to get on his knees to pray probably because he wanted to show how much he cared for the Ephesians when he prayed for them.

Stop here and discuss the following question. What is the normal prayer position for your people when they pray in public? Do they use the same position when they pray in private? What does kneeling in prayer symbolize to your people? Pause the audio here.

Paul says he is praying to the Father. Paul is talking about God who is Paul's heavenly father. Paul identifies the Father as being the creator of everything in heaven and on earth. Some translations say that God, the Father, gives every family, or group of people on earth its name. Another translation says that God gives all people their life. In other words, everything and every person comes from God. Paul is praying to his heavenly father who is the father of all life and who gives fatherhood to each family. Paul may have been thinking about Roman fathers who kept their authority over their children as long as they lived. Paul means that God, who lives forever, is our father forever. Some Jews believed that the angels were the families above in heaven and the people were the families on earth. After saying all this as his introduction to the prayer, Paul now asks God for some specific things.

Paul asks God who has great blessings in heaven to give the Ephesians power and strength. Paul is trying to explain that God has great glory, or majesty and power. It is like God is rich with glory like a person is rich with money. God is so rich in power that he uses his power to give us spiritual strength. God brings us his power in the Holy Spirit when he gives the Holy Spirit to his believers. This strength makes the believers strongly trust in God. It's not a strength you can see, but a strength that is inside a person. The person who has this strength is strong in his heart or in his mind.

Pause here and discuss the following question. Tell a story about someone with inner strength who remains strong in his faith. Who gives this person their strength? What does he or she do? Does the storyteller use a specific body part to describe where this inner strength lies? For example: strong in your heart or strong in your mind. Pause the audio here.

Paul is talking about Christ living permanently in the hearts of the believers. Because they have believed in Jesus Christ or trusted in Jesus, Paul is asking that the believers will always trust in Christ, which is like Christ always living with them and in them.

Then Paul uses two different comparisons to describe God's love. \[Paul wants the believers to understand Christ's love, but it's really difficult! So Paul gives us some ways to think about understanding it. First Paul prays that believers will be "rooted and established" in love. Paul uses the idea of strong tree roots that can stand strong even in a storm. Then Paul talks about establishing a house foundation. A house in Paul's time usually had a strong foundation of stone that kept it steady in wind or storms. Paul says that like strong tree roots and a strong house foundation, God's people need to have a strong love for God and for people, so that they will be able to continue following God.]{.mark}

Stop here and show a picture of a tree with deep roots. Pause the audio here.

Stop here and show a picture of the stone foundation of a house. Pause the audio here.

As people grow in their love for God and for people, they will have power to understand even more just how much God loves them. Paul asks God to give the followers of Jesus the power or the ability to understand Christ's love. Paul talks about the saints or any person who believes in Jesus Christ. This means not just the Ephesian believers but anyone who ever believes in Jesus. One way to say this is, "You, together with all God's people..." Paul wants the believers to know that Christ's love has no limit. Paul uses a word picture of a building or a structure that is high, wide and deep to say that Christ's love has no limits. Paul says that this love is too great for us to understand completely. But we still need to experience this love and when we do, we will be complete or whole with all the good things like life and power that come from the very nature of God.

Stop here and as a group describe someone you know who seems to live a complete or full life in God. What kinds of things do they do? How do they show God's love and character in the things that they do? Pause this audio here.

Paul finishes his prayer by praising God. This part of the prayer is like a song or praise to God. Paul asks that all glory be given to God. God is able to do greater things within the believers than we can possibly imagine. God uses His mighty power to do this. We need to give God the glory or praise for what He does both in the believers, his church, and in Christ Jesus. Paul says that this is to continue through all generations, or all people to come in the future.

Stop here and discuss how you might end a prayer of joy and thanksgiving in your culture. Pause the audio here.

Paul has followed the Jewish custom of ending a prayer with a blessing to God. Part of this custom was to respond to prayers and benedictions by saying "Amen." Amen means "let it be" or "I agree with what has been said." Today, we often say "amen" to let people know that we have finished praying. Most likely, Paul used the word here to show that he wants everything to happen as he has prayed it would.

**This is the end of the recording.**

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 3:14–21 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has 2 parts..

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* God who inspires Paul
* Jesus Christ
* The Holy Spirit
* The saints or the believers in the church
* Other believers through the generations to come

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage. Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama. Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

In part one, Paul tells the believers that when Paul thinks of how the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers are united as one body or one church, Paul gets on his knees to pray to God the Father. **Pause the drama.** Ask Paul, "How are you feeling right now?" You may hear, "I love these Gentile believers. I am so glad that God sees them as God's full children, equal to the Jewish believers. I'm so glad that God has brought them together to form one body and they are equal in God's eyes. The church will be so strong because of this. I am humbled when I think of my part in this when all I did was share the Good News with them all. I just want to praise God for this." Continue the drama.

Paul asks God to use God's unlimited resources to give inner strength to all the believers. Paul asks that God use His Holy Spirit to give this power to the believers. Paul also asks that Jesus Christ would live in the heart of each believer as that believer trusts or believes in Jesus. **Pause the drama.** Ask the believers, "How do you feel when you hear Paul praying this prayer?" You may hear, "It makes me feel glad. Paul wants the best for us. Paul wants us to be strong in our faith. It seems that the way to do this is to ask God to give us the strength we need. Paul shows how much he loves us when he prays like this. I think it means that God loves us too and wants us to have this inner strength. When I know that Jesus lives in me, I feel so humble. It makes me want to remember that wherever I go or whatever I do, I have Jesus with me because Jesus lives inside me. This is an incredible gift. I hope I can be worthy of this gift." Continue the drama.

Paul uses the picture of deep tree roots and the picture of a strong foundation of a house to remind the believers of how important it is that they have God's love. With God's love, they will be strong. Paul wants the believers to begin to understand how high and how wide and how deep God's love is. Even with this picture, Paul tells the believers that it will be hard for them to fully understand God's love. Paul wants the believers to experience the love of Christ. Paul asks that the believers have the life and power that comes from God. This is a full life and full power. **Pause the drama.** Ask the believers, "How do you feel when you hear Paul talking about God's love like this?" You may hear, "I thought I was understanding God's love for me, but now I'm seeing that God's love is so much bigger than I ever thought. It seems like I will keep learning about God's love for me the rest of my life. I love thinking about how the tree roots make the tree strong when there is a lot of wind. I've seen a tree with poor roots fall over in the wind. I want my own experience with God's love to be like the tree with deep roots. I am looking forward to having this fullness of life and power that Paul has been talking about. I hope that others who don't yet believe in Jesus will see this power and fullness of life in me and it will make them want to follow Jesus." Continue the drama.

Paul concludes his prayer by praising God. Paul gives glory to God because God can do even more than we can think to ask for. God uses His mighty power to work within the believers. Paul also praises both God and Jesus because of what they have done in the church or group of believers. Paul wants all generations to come to praise God. Paul finishes by saying, "Amen." **Pause the drama.** Ask Paul, "How do you feel when you think about God using His mighty power to work within the believers?" You may hear, "I get excited about what might happen if the believers experience God's love like they should. If the believers know that God is working in them through God's mighty power, then there is nothing the believers can't do for Christ. They will be able to tell others about Jesus. People will see God at work in their lives and be amazed by what they see. The church will grow and grow. I want this so very much and I feel really excited thinking about it."

**This is the end of the recording.**

Listen to an audio version of Ephesians 3:14–21 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul says, "I pray to the **Father**, the **Creator** of everything" or the father of all the fathers on earth. Father refers to heavenly father or to God. Paul uses the same word for father that you use for your own fathers. Be sure that your listeners understand that Paul is talking about God, the Father, and use the same word for Father that you have used in previous passages. Creator means the person who creates or makes something from nothing. God created the universe and everything in it.

Paul says that God created the families, or groups of people, in **heaven** and on earth. Use the same word for heaven that you have used in previous passages, and remember that heaven is in the master glossary.

Paul talks about the riches of God's **glory**. Glory is about how beautiful, powerful and majestic God is. Glory is discussed in the master glossary. Use the same word for glory that you have used when translating previous passages.

God will use His **Spirit** or the **Holy Spirit** to give us inner strength. The Holy Spirit is discussed in the master glossary. Use the same phrase for the Holy Spirit that you have been using.

**Christ** will live in your hearts. Christ is discussed in the master glossary. Use the same word for Christ you have been using. In your heart refers to the center of your thoughts and emotions.

Stop here and discuss the wording you have chosen to describe what in your heart means. Pause the audio here.

Paul asks that Christ would live in the hearts of the believers through **faith** or because they trust in Jesus. Faith is discussed in the master glossary. Use the same word for faith you have been using.

Paul wants all the **saints** or all of God's people to understand God's love. Saint is discussed in the master glossary. Use the same word for saint that you have been using.

Paul asks for this glory to God to be in all **generations** to come. Another way to say this is "through the ages to come." Paul wants all the people from now into the future to experience this love and power from God. Generations is discussed in the master glossary. Use the same word for generations you have been using.

Paul ends the prayer by saying **amen**. Amen is the usual response given at the end of a prayer. It has the meaning of agreeing with what the person has said and saying that this is true.

Stop here and discuss as a group: What word or phrase will you use for amen? Use the same word that you have used in other books of the Bible. Amen is in the master glossary.

Listen to an audio version of the passage in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

In this session, retell the passage, as a group, in your own language.

First, the whole group should practice telling the passage in your own language. Remember to include the things you decided in previous steps, like chronology, words, phrases, emotions, or anything else you discussed.

One group member should tell a few sentences of the passage and pause. Another group member should tell the next part of the passage and pause. Do this until the group has retold the whole passage. The group members can correct each other in this step. Pause this audio here.

Next, each member of the group should tell the whole passage without interruption at least one time. A group member can use random objects, motions, or their storyboard to help them remember the passage. Pause this audio here.

Next, the group can decide whose version of the passage you like the most. You may decide that you liked the way one group member told one scene but you liked the way a different group member told another scene. Pause this audio here.

Finally, the group can put together a final version of the passage that everyone agrees on. Each group member should practice telling this final version of the passage.

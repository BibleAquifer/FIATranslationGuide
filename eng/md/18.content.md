## Job 1:1–5 (id: 877394)

Hear and Heart
--------------

Hear Job 1:1–5 and put it in your heart. Listen to the text three times (in three different translations, if possible). Then as a team discuss the following questions:

1. What do you like in this story?
2. What do you not like or not understand?
3. What does this story tell us about God?
4. What does this story tell us about people?
5. How does this story affect our daily life?
6. Who do you know who needs to hear this story?

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to the text once in the easiest to understand version.

This is a narrative story about a man named Job. He is the main character in the book. His story begins with this first story. Job lived in the land of Uz. The exact location of Uz is unknown. Job was **blameless** and **upright**. This means that Job always did his best to obey God. He also **feared God** and **turned away from evil**. This means that he always avoided any words or actions that might make God angry.

Job had seven sons and three daughters. A later story will show that Job also had a wife. He also had 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and a great number of servants. Job's many possessions show that he is the wealthiest man in the east. The people living in this specific area are unknown. The main idea is that Job was the wealthiest man in the region where he lives. Job's wealth shows that God blessed him greatly.

Stop and discuss the following question: What are the things that are normally owned by a wealthy person in your culture?

Job's sons had a custom of celebrating **feasts** in each of their houses. A feast was typically held to celebrate an important occasion or event. It was celebrated by eating and drinking different food and drinks. The exact feasts that Job's sons celebrated were unclear. But they took turns in celebrating them. When they did, they also invited their sisters.

Job had a custom too. When the feasts are over, Job sends someone, perhaps a servant, to have his sons come to him. When they come, Job consecrates them. It is unclear how Job consecrated his sons. **Consecration** was the practice of making something or someone pure in the sight of God. A person that undergoes consecration typically takes a bath and washes his clothes. The next day, Job wakes up early in the morning to offer burnt offerings to God for each of his sons. Job might have consecrated his sons so that God will be pleased when Job offers burnt offerings for them. **Burnt offering** is a ritual where a person kills an animal, drains its blood, and burns the body of the animal on top of an altar. It is offered for several reasons. One of the reasons is to ask God to forgive them of their sins. This is also the reason that Job regularly did this. Job thought that his children might have **sinned** and disobeyed God, or they might have cursed God in their hearts. Here **curse God in their hearts** means that they might have thoughts that could anger God. Job always offered sacrifices to God on behalf of his sons so that they are always pure in the sight of God. This shows that Job was truly blameless and upright. He feared God and hated evil.

Stop and discuss this as a team: Describe a person in your culture that has the same character as Job.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to the text once again in the easiest to understand version.

In this session, you will help the group visualize this story. You will help the group define the scenes, setting, and characters of the story.

This story has three scenes.

**First Scene:** Job was blameless and upright. He feared God and turned away from evil. Job has seven sons and three daughters. A later story will show that Job has a wife. However, the names of Job's wife and children are not mentioned. Job has many animals and servants.

**Second Scene:** Job's sons will take turns organizing a feast in their own homes. They will invite their sisters to be part of the feasts. A feast typically involved eating and drinking a wide variety of food and drinks.

**Third Scene:** Job will send a servant to call all his sons to his home. When they arrive, Job will consecrate them by telling them to wash themselves and their clothes. The next morning, Job will sacrifice burnt offerings for each of his sons. Job will do this because he thinks to himself that perhaps his sons committed sins against God.

The characters in this story include:

* Job
* Job's sons
* Job's daughters
* Job's servants

In this session, have the group storyboard, draw out, or use some sort of manipulatives to visualize the story and the action in it.

In scene one, be sure to show Job's great wealth. Job's wealth was his many animals and servants. You may use any object that may represent Job's animals. You may also label them and indicate their number to show that they are many. You may do the same with Job's servants.

In scene two, be sure to show that there are different food and drinks when Job's children eat. You may use any object that may represent these different foods and drinks. Be sure also to show that they will take turns in their houses when they hold their feasts. They will also invite their sisters or send some servants to invite their sisters. Remember to show that the feasts lasted for several days, and that they celebrated them regularly.

In scene three, remember to show that Job sent some servants to call his sons to his place. In consecrating them, the children will wash themselves and their clothes. When Job offers the burnt offerings, remember to have an altar where the animal will be sacrificed. An altar was made of piles of stones that were put together so that an animal could be placed on top of it. Job may take seven animals from his many animals. He will offer one animal for each of his sons. Remember to show that Job did this regularly every time his sons will finish their time of feasting. Remember that Job will think to himself why he is always offering for his sons.

Stop and discuss the following question: How does a person in your culture show that he or she is thinking deeply about something? How do you talk about this?

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to the text once again in the easiest to understand version.

In this session, the team will dramatize the story.

This story has three scenes.

The characters in this story include:

* Job
* Job's sons
* Job's daughters
* Job's servants

Have the team act out the story twice. They should act it out in the language they are translating into. First, have the team act out the story without stopping. The second time the team acts out the story, stop them at different points in the story.

As the team acts out the story the first time, pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the story. Look out for the important or difficult parts of the story or passage to be acted out and not skipped. Help the team remember parts of the story.

The second time the team acts out this story, stop them at certain points.

In scene one, Job introduces himself. His sons will describe his character. He will also show his family and all his possessions.

Stop the action: Ask the actor playing Job, "How do you feel?" You may hear things like, "I thank God for he has blessed so much!" or "God really blesses the people who obey him!" Restart the action.

In scene two, Job's sons will take turns in celebrating feasts in their own homes. They will also invite their sisters.

Stop the action: Ask the actor playing one of Job's sons, "How do you feel?" You may hear things like, "We praise God for blessing our father Job so that we are blessed too" or "We should be like our father, Job. God is pleased with him." Restart the action.

In scene three, Job will send a servant to call his sons to his home. Job will consecrate them. The next day, Job will offer burnt offerings to God for each of them.

Stop the action: Ask the actor playing Job, "How do you feel?" You may hear things like, "I need to make these offerings to God on behalf of my sons in case they sinned or cursed God in their hearts" or "I want to make sure that my children are also pure and pleasing in God's eyes."

Job did this regularly.

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to the text once again in the easiest to understand version.

This story introduces Job who is the main character of the book. Job is **blameless** and **upright**. These two words are often used together to describe that Job was a man of integrity. He was a man who pleased God with the way he lived his life. Blameless does not mean that a person no longer sins. Rather, it describes a person that strives to obey God by serving God, by being honest, by showing kindness to others, and by helping those in need. Upright literally means straight. In the story it means that Job was like walking on a straight path. This is another way of saying that Job followed God's ways. Job also **feared God** and he **turned away from evil**. The fear of God is an Old Testament expression that refers to the act of living with constant awareness of God's control over the world and over a person's life. For more information about fear or fear of God, you may refer to the Master Glossary. Turning away from evil is an expression that describes a person's desire to do good rather than evil. In other words, Job was a man who obeyed and pleased God.

Job had seven sons and three daughters. He owned lots of animals and a great number of servants. He was the wealthiest man in the land where he lived.

Job's sons held **feasts** in their own homes. A feast was typically held to celebrate an important occasion or event. It was celebrated by eating and drinking lots of different food and drinks. They took turns, and they invited their sisters each time they celebrated.

Job called his sons to his home after all the feasts. Then he **consecrated** them. Consecration was the practice of making something or someone pure in the sight of God. A person that undergoes consecration typically takes a bath and washes his clothes. The next morning, Job offered **burnt offerings** to God for each of his sons. Burnt offering is a ritual that involves the killing and the burning of an animal sacrifice. It is offered for various reasons, such as when a person wants to thank God or ask God for something. Another reason is to ask God for forgiveness of sins. In the story, this was Job's reason for the burnt offerings. For more information about burnt offering, you may refer to the Master Glossary. Job did this regularly because he feared that his sons might have **sinned** against God and **cursed God in their hearts**. Sin means disobedience to God. Cursing is when a person wishes for something unpleasant to happen to another person. Cursing God in the heart is when a person has evil thoughts against God. You may refer to the Master Glossary for more information about sin and curse.

## Job 1:6–12 (id: 877396)

Hear and Heart
--------------

Hear Job 1:6–12 and put it in your heart. Listen to the text three times (in three different translations, if possible). Then as a team discuss the following questions:

1. What do you like in this story?
2. What do you not like or not understand?
3. What does this story tell us about God?
4. What does this story tell us about people?
5. How does this story affect our daily life?
6. Who do you know who needs to hear this story?

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to the text once in the easiest to understand version.

The previous story introduced Job as the main character of the story. He was blameless and upright. He feared God and turned away from evil. God blessed Job so much that Job owned a great number of animals and servants. He was the wealthiest man in the region where he lived.

The present story shows a conversation between God and Satan. One day the **sons of God** came to present themselves before God. The Sons of God refers to the spirit beings that were servants of God. As God had human servants, God also had spirit servants. These spirit servants were called sons of God. As servants, God gave them work to do and they were required to present themselves before God, or to report the progress of their work to God. The name of God used in this story is Yahweh, the personal name for God, except for the word "sons of God" and except when God and Satan will mention the word, "God."

**Satan** also came to report his work to God. This means that he was part of God's spirit servants. In the Hebrew, Satan means enemy or accuser. It is not a person's name. Rather, it is a title that describes what this person does. His main action is to challenge or accuse people to see if they really love God. He cannot do anything without God's permission.

God asked Satan where he came from. This is another way of saying that God was asking Satan to begin his report. Satan responds by saying what he had been doing. He had been going around the earth to observe and test all the people in the world. God asked Satan if Satan had considered Job. God said that Job was his servant. There was no one like Job who is **blameless** and **upright**. This means that Job obeyed God. Job also **feared God** and **turned away from evil**. This means that he avoided evil deeds, thoughts, and words that might make God angry. In other words, Job was not only the wealthiest man in his region. He was also the most upright man in the world. Nobody pleases God like Job.

In a form of question, Satan says that Job only feared God because God was blessing and protecting Job and his family. Then Satan challenged God to stretch his hand, or reach out and touch, all of Job's properties. In other words, Satan was challenging God to take away all the blessing and protection that God was giving Job. Satan was certain that if God would do that, Job would **curse God to his face**. In the previous story, Job feared that his sons might have cursed God in their hearts, or had thoughts that are against God. Here, "Cursing God to his face" means speaking evil words against God. If Job curses God to his face, it will prove that Satan was right, that Job only feared God because of God's blessings.

Stop and discuss the following question: What are actions or words in your culture that are considered evil and might make God angry?

God responds to Satan's challenge. God said, "**Behold**, everything he has in your hands. Only do not stretch your hand against him." The word "Behold" is an expression that is used to slow down the flow of speech, so that the listener will pay close attention to the important information after it. In this case, it means that God accepted Satan's challenge. But he set conditions for it. God is ultimately responsible for everything that happens. God did not do this himself, but he allowed Satan to do it. God also said that Satan could take away everything that Job had. But God did not allow Satan to harm Job. After this, Satan left God's presence. Note that when Satan left, he did not say anything to God. Because of this we don't know what Satan thought or felt, and what he planned to do when he left God's presence.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to the text once again in the easiest to understand version.

In this session, you will help the group visualize this story. You will help the group define the scenes, setting, and characters of the story.

This story has two scenes.

**First Scene:** The sons of God or the spirit beings will present themselves before God. Satan will also attend the meeting. The sons of God will report the status of their work to God.

**Second Scene:** God and Satan will have a conversation about Job which will result in God giving permission to Satan to challenge Job's character.

The characters in this story include:

* God
* Sons of God
* Satan

In this session, have the group storyboard, draw out, or use some sort of manipulatives to visualize the story and the action in it.

It is important to remember that this new story takes place in a new setting. The story begins with a phrase like "Now the day came," or "One day," to show that this is a new story. The previous story showed the earth where Job and his family lived. We don't know where the present story actually takes place. But because it shows God in his place, the setting of the story seems to be in heaven where God lives.

In scene one, God is in a position of authority and hearing the reports from his servants. God is portrayed as king in other stories, so when he meets his servants, he may be sitting on his throne. Then his many spirit servants are coming to where God was so they could report to him. Satan will be among the spirit servants. But only God and Satan will talk in the next scene.

In scene two, when God asks Satan if Satan had already considered Job, God was asking a question. In this story, the important information is Job's character that God will reveal. Satan will respond in a form of a question. He was saying that Job only feared God because God was blessing him. Then Satan makes a clear contrast in his speech. He says something opposite to his previous statement. So, Satan challenged God to remove all of Job's blessings and Job will certainly curse God to his face. Then God emphasizes his next statement by starting with a word that points to the important information that follows it. He says, "Behold," or "All right, everything he has is in your hands. Only do not hurt his body." God accepts Satan's challenge. But God says that Satan can only remove Job's possessions; he cannot harm Job. Satan agrees and leaves God's presence to begin his challenge on Job.

Stop the action: Ask the actor playing God, "How do you feel?" You may hear things like, "I am glad that my spirit servants have accomplished their work." or "I wonder if Satan has considered Job my servant. I should ask him." Restart the action.

In scene two, God will ask Satan about Job. He'll describe Job, his servant, as blameless, upright, fearing God, and turning away from evil. No one in the world pleases God like Job. Satan will respond and say that Job is only fearing God because God has been blessing Job and his family. But if God will remove all of Job's blessing and protection, Job will certainly curse God to his face.

Stop the action: Ask the actor playing God, "How do you feel?" You may hear things like, "I am sure that Job will remain blameless and upright, fearing God and turning away from evil even if he loses everything" or "In order to prove Satan wrong, I will accept his challenge, but he must see it for himself." Restart the action.

So, God agrees to Satan's challenge. He says that Satan can take away everything that Job had, but he cannot touch Job.

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to the text once again in the easiest to understand version.

One day the **sons of God** came to present themselves before God. The Sons of God refers to the spirit beings, or in other places called **angels**, that were servants of God. As God had human servants, God had spirit servants as well. This shows that God is king in both heaven and on earth. It shows his power and control over everything that happens in the world. God's spirit servants were called sons of God. As servants, God gave them work to do and they were required to present themselves before God, or to report the progress of their work to God. You may refer to the Master Glossary for more information about sons of God or angels. Remember that the name of **God** used in this story is **Yahweh**, the personal name for God, except for the word "sons of God" and except when God and Satan will mention the word, "God." Your team should translate the personal name of God, Yahweh, in the same way you have in other stories and remember that Yahweh is in the Master Glossary.

**Satan** also came to present himself. In the Hebrew, "Satan" means enemy or accuser. It is not a person's name. Rather, it is a title that is associated with the work that God assigned him. His main job is to challenge or test people to see if they really love and obey God. You may call this character either as "Satan the accuser" or just "the accuser." For more information about Satan, you may refer to the Master Glossary.

God begins the conversation with Satan. He asks Satan if Satan had seen his servant, Job. God said that there is no one like Job who is **blameless** and **upright**. These two words are often used together to describe that Job was a man of integrity. He was a man who pleased God with the way he lived his life. Blameless does not mean that a person no longer sins. Rather it means that he strives to obey God by serving God, by being honest, by showing kindness to others, and by helping those in need. Upright literally means straight. In the story it means that Job was like walking on a straight path. This is another way of saying that Job followed God's ways. Job also **feared God** and he **turned away from evil**. The fear of God is an Old Testament expression that refers to the act of living with constant awareness of God's control over the world and over a person's life. For more information about fear or fear of God, you may refer to the Master Glossary. Turning away from evil is an expression that describes a person's desire to always do good rather than evil. In other words, Job was a man who obeyed and pleased God.

Satan responds to God and says that Job feared God only because God was blessing and protecting Job and his family. Then Satan proposes a test. If God removes his blessings and protection from Job, Satan says that Job will surely **curse God to his face**. Cursing is when a person wishes for something unpleasant to happen to another person. Cursing God to his face is when a person speaks words or has thoughts that are against God. You may refer to the Master Glossary for more information about the word curse.

God accepts Satan's challenge and says, "**Behold**, everything he has in your hands." Here, "behold" is an expression that is typically said before a very important statement. It is also translated in English as "Look!" or "All right." It has the effect of slowing the flow of speech to prepare the reader or listener for an important statement. God also says, "Only do not stretch your hand against him." This expression means that God is not allowing Satan to harm Job. Satan accepts the conditions and leaves God's presence.

## Job 1:13–22 (id: 877398)

Hear and Heart
--------------

Hear Job 1:13–22 and put it in your heart. Listen to the text three times (in three different translations, if possible). Then as a team discuss the following questions:

1. What do you like in this story?
2. What do you not like or not understand?
3. What does this story tell us about God?
4. What does this story tell us about people?
5. How does this story affect our daily life?
6. Who do you know who needs to hear this story?

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to the text once in the easiest to understand version.

The previous story told about the conversation between God and Satan. God said that nobody was like his servant Job who was upright and feared God. But Satan said that Job feared God only because of God's blessings and protection. Satan proposed to test Job in order to show that he was right. God agreed and gave permission to Satan to remove all of Job's possessions. But Satan cannot harm Job. Satan agrees and leaves to begin his test on Job's character.

In the present story, Job's wealth of animals, servants, and even his children will die. God and Satan are not mentioned as actors in this story. But the following story will reveal that both God and Satan were watching everything that happens to Job.

The story begins with the scene where Job's children are gathered together. Remember that in the previous story, Job's children had a custom of celebrating feasts in each other's house. Here, Job's children were drinking wine and eating in the house of their oldest brother.

During this time, a messenger came to Job at Job's house, and said that the Sabeans fell upon his servants and struck them with the edge of the sword. This is another way of saying that a group of people called the Sabeans suddenly attacked and killed Job's servants. We don't know much about the Sabeans mentioned here. The servants that they killed were probably herders who are helping the oxen plow the fields. The Sabeans took the oxen and donkeys and killed all the servants.

Stop and show a picture of oxen plowing fields and a picture of donkeys feeding.

The messenger reporting this news was the only one that escaped.

While this messenger was still reporting, another messenger came to Job. He said that the fire of God fell from heaven and burned to death all his sheep together with the servants that were watching over them. The fire of God mentioned here may be referring to a lightning strike.

Stop and show a picture of a lightning strike.

The messenger reporting this was the only one that escaped.

While this messenger was still reporting, another messenger came to Job. He said that the Chaldeans came in three groups and killed his servants that were watching over his camels. The Chaldeans were a people group who lived in the southern part of Babylon. The Chaldeans that attacked Job's servants also took with them all the camels that they were watching over. The messenger reporting this was the only one that escaped.

While this messenger was still reporting, another messenger came to Job. He said that a great wind, perhaps a desert storm, came across the wilderness while his children were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house.

Stop and show a picture of a strong desert storm.

This great wind hit the house where his children were staying and destroyed the house which also killed every one of his children. The messenger reporting this was the only one that escaped.

Job's animals, servants, and children showed God's favor upon Job. They showed that God had supplied him with everything he needed. At the same time, Job's children ensured that Job's family line will continue to the next generations. But when Job lost all these things, Job also lost his status as a blessed man. For many people at that time, Job will look like a man who is cursed by God.

Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head. These were common actions for expressing grief and sorrow. This means that Job mourned for the death of his animals, servants, and children.

Stop and discuss the following question: How do people in your culture express their grief when they mourn after a great tragedy?

Then, he **fell to the ground** and **worshiped** God. In ancient times, worship was when a person kneels and bows his head to the ground before a person. This was a way of showing that the person kneeling praises and honors the person in front of him. He said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return." Job accepted all his losses. After all, he was born into the world without any property or children. So, he accepted dying in this world with nothing. He also accepted God's control over his life. He said that if God can give him blessings, God can certainly take them away as he wishes. So Job praised God.

In all this, Job did not **sin** or disobey God. Job neither spoke anything evil against God. The word for God in this passage is God, except when Job is talking. Job calls God his personal name, Yahweh.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to the text once again in the easiest to understand version.

In this session, you will help the group visualize this story. You will help the group define the scenes, setting, and characters of the story.

This story has two scenes.

**First Scene:** While Job's sons and daughters are gathered in the house of their oldest brothers, multiple messengers will come to Job. They will report the series of tragedies that will result in the loss of his animals, and the deaths of his servants and children.

**Second Scene:** Job will mourn over his losses but will also worship God. He will accept his losses and respect God's control over his life. So that, in all of these, Job kept his upright character.

The characters in this story include:

* Job
* Job's four messengers
* God
* Satan

In this session, have the group storyboard, draw out, or use some sort of manipulatives to visualize the story and the action in it.

The previous story was set in heaven where God lives. The setting of the present story is now back on earth where Job and his family live. Here, bad things will happen to them just as God and Satan had talked about.

God and Satan are not actors in this story. But a later story will show that God and Satan were actually watching everything that happens to Job. This means God and Satan may be depicted as watching from a distance in this story.

At any rate, most of the story are reports of the messengers who came to Job. This means that the story may have been set in Job's house. The introduction about the feasting of Job's children also tells when the reported events took place. They all happened while his children were celebrating an important occasion.

In scene one, the four messengers will come one after another. They will report each tragedy to Job. When portraying this scene, it is important to show that one event followed after another immediately. So that while the first messenger is speaking, the second messenger will come and report. Then, while the second messenger is speaking, the third messenger will come and report. Then, while the third messenger is speaking, the fourth messenger will report. For the messengers, the report that they have are too important and urgent to be delayed. So, they report as soon as they see Job even as the previous messenger is still speaking. It is also important to note that when the fourth messenger reports, he used a special word that is typically used to get the listener's attention. He will say this after he mentions where Job's sons and daughters were. The messenger will use this to get Job's attention so that he will listen to the most important news about the death of his children. The mention of Job's sons and daughters at the beginning and end of the reports is also important. This shows that all the reported tragedies happened in one day.

In scene two, Job will rise after hearing the reports. Job was likely sitting or lying somewhere as he heard the reports from the messengers. Then he will tear his robe and shave his head to show that he is mourning in deep sorrow for everything that he has lost. Yet afterward, Job will fall on the ground and worship God. Worshiping God was an act that involved kneeling, bowing to the ground. Worship also involved speaking praises to God. In the story, Job's words of praise are reported. Job's response will show that Job did not sin or say anything evil against God.

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to the text once again in the easiest to understand version.

In this session, the team will dramatize the story.

This story has two scenes.

The characters in this story include:

* Job
* Job's four messengers
* God
* Satan

Have the team act out the story twice. They should act it out in the language they are translating into. First, have the team act out the story without stopping. The second time the team acts out the story, stop them at different points in the story.

As the team acts out the story the first time, pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the story. Look out for the important or difficult parts of the story or passage to be acted out and not skipped. Help the team remember parts of the story.

The second time the team acts out this story, stop them at certain points.

It is important to remember that all the reports have the same pattern. Something bad happens, only one person will survive the tragedy, then he will come to report the bad news to Job.

In scene one, four messengers will report the bad things that happened to Job's animals, servants, and children. After the first messenger reports, the three other messengers will follow one at a time. Each of them will report as soon as they come to Job even though the other messenger is not yet finished speaking. As the third messenger comes to Job,

Stop the action: Ask the actor playing Job, "How do you feel?" You may hear things like, "Two tragedies already happened! Is this third messenger also bringing more bad news?" or "I hope that this third messenger will deliver some good news!" Restart the action.

These reports show that Job lost everything he had in one day.

Stop the action: Ask the actor playing Job, "How do you feel?" You may hear things like, "My animals, servants, and children are the symbols of God's blessings to me. Now that they're gone, people will now see me as cursed" or "I'm sure God has reasons why these things happened." Restart the action.

In scene two, Job will mourn over the death of his animals, servants, and most especially his children. Yet Job will also worship God.

Stop the action: Ask the actor playing Job, "How do you feel?" You may hear things like, "I trust God. This is hard and I am overwhelmed with sadness. But I have peace that God is in control" or "I am extremely sad about everything I lost. But I know that God has a reason for all of this."

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to the text once again in the easiest to understand version.

One day Job's sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house. During this time, a messenger came to Job and reported that the **Sabeans** attacked and killed his servants in the field. The Sabeans were the name of a group of people of unclear origin.

While this messenger was speaking, another messenger reported that the **fire of God** struck and burned to death all of Job's sheep and the servants that were watching over them. The fire of God mentioned is an Old Testament expression that refers to lightning.

While this messenger was speaking another came to report that the **Chaldeans** attacked Job's other servants. The Chaldeans were a people group who lived in the land called Chaldea. In the earlier times, Chaldea was located on the southern part of Babylonia. In the following centuries, Chaldea would grow and become another name for the whole land of Babylon.

While the messenger was speaking, another came to report that a **great wind** came and struck the house where Job's sons and daughters were staying. The nature of this wind is unclear. But the wind is so strong that it destroyed the house. Before reporting what happened to Job's children, the messenger used the Hebrew word that is typically said before a very important statement. It is often translated as "**Behold**" or "**Look**!" It has the effect of slowing the flow of speech to prepare the reader or listener for an important statement. Then the messenger reports that when the house was destroyed, Job's children were also killed.

Yet afterward, Job **worshiped** God. Worship to God refers to the act of bowing to the ground and praising God for his greatness. You may refer to the Master Glossary for more information about the word, worship. Job **blessed** the name of Lord. Remember that the word bless here is also in the Master Glossary. The word Lord here refers to Yahweh, God's personal name. You may refer to the Master Glossary for more information about the words for God and Yahweh.

In all these, Job did not **sin**, or disobey God. Job also did not speak any evil word against God or blame him for all the things he lost. You may refer to the Master Glossary for more information about sin.

## Job 2:1–6 (id: 877400)

Hear and Heart
--------------

Hear Job 2:1–6 and put it in your heart. Listen to the text three times (in three different translations, if possible). Then as a team discuss the following questions:

1. What do you like in this story?
2. What do you not like or not understand?
3. What does this story tell us about God?
4. What does this story tell us about people?
5. How does this story affect our daily life?
6. Who do you know who needs to hear this story?

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to the text once in the easiest to understand version.

The previous story was about Job's tragedies. Remember that after God told Satan about Job's integrity, Satan said that Job only feared God because God was blessing and protecting him. He said that if God will remove everything from him, Job will surely curse God to his face. God allowed Satan to take away all the things that made Job blessed. As a result, Job lost his animals, servants, and children. When a person loses everything like what happened to Job, people at that time thought that God was cursing that person. Because Job lost everything, people might think that God was cursing him. Yet, rather than curse God, Job worshiped God and did not sin despite losing everything.

The present story shows another conversation between God and Satan. Just like the first time, there was a day when the **sons of God** came to present themselves before God. The Sons of God refers to the spirit beings that were servants of God. As God had human servants, God also had spirit servants. These spirit servants were called sons of God. As servants, God gave them work to do and they were required to present themselves before God, or to report the progress of their work to God. The name of God used in this story is Yahweh, except for the word, "son of God" and except for when God refers to himself.

**Satan** also came to report his work to God. This means that he was part of God's spirit servants. In the Hebrew, Satan means enemy or accuser. It is not a person's name. Rather, it is a title that describes what this person does. His main action is to challenge or accuse people to see if they really love God. He cannot do anything without God's permission.

God asked Satan where he came from. This is another way of saying that God was asking Satan to begin his report. Satan responds by saying what he had been doing. He had been going around the earth to observe and test all the people in the world. God asked Satan if Satan had considered Job. God said that Job was his servant. There was no one like Job who is **blameless** and **upright**. This means that Job obeyed God. Job also **feared God** and **turned away from evil**. This means that he avoided evil deeds, thoughts, and words that might make God angry.

God said that Satan **incited** him to **destroy** Job **without reason**. This means that Satan convinced God to deal great harm on Job even though Job did not deserve it. The first conversation between God and Satan ended with God allowing Satan to challenge Job. It showed that Satan was responsible for Job's losses even though Satan was not mentioned in the story. But God's remarks here shows that God was also responsible for Job's tragedies. In ancient times, the actions and words of a king's servant were viewed as the actions and words of the king himself. The servant representing the king carries the authority of the king. Despite this, Job maintained his **integrity**. Job's integrity means that he remained upright and he did his best to avoid sinning against God.

God telling Satan about Job's response even before Satan speaks shows that God was watching Job as he lost everything. Satan will respond and agree with God. This means Satan was watching Job too as he lost everything. This means that both God and Satan were watching Job in the previous story even though they were not mentioned. This will be the reason that Satan will propose another test on Job's integrity.

Satan answered God and said, "Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life." This expression means that when a person's life is in danger, he would normally find a way to save himself. If he needs to give up everything that he has, he will do it to avoid the threat or danger. Satan has more to say to clarify what this means for Job. Satan says, "But stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will "**Curse you to your face**." The meaning of this expression shows that Satan was telling God to bring severe pain and suffering on Job's body. God did not allow Job to be harmed before. This time, Satan was asking God to inflict harm on Job himself. Satan was certain that if God would do this, Job would give up his integrity and finally curse God to his face. Cursing God to his face means speaking evil words against God. If Job curses God to his face, it will prove that Satan was right, that Job only feared God because of God's blessings.

Stop and discuss the following question: What are actions or words in your culture that are considered evil and might provoke God's anger?

God responds and says, "**Behold**, he is in your hands." This means that God agrees to Satan's proposal. But just like the first instance, God tells Satan to do it himself. God also sets a condition for the challenge. Satan may inflict harm on Job's body, but Satan must not kill Job.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to the text once again in the easiest to understand version.

In this session, you will help the group visualize this story. You will help the group define the scenes, setting, and characters of the story.

This story has two scenes.

**First Scene:** The sons of God will come before the presence of God. Satan also will present himself before God.

**Second Scene:** God and Satan will have a conversation about Job which will result in God giving permission to Satan to challenge Job's character.

The characters in this story include:

* God
* Sons of God
* Satan

In this session, have the group storyboard, draw out, or use some sort of manipulatives to visualize the story and the action in it.

It is important to remember that this story is closely connected to the previous. It begins with a word that usually indicates that the story already happened before. The previous story showed earth where Job lived. Now, the scene is back on heaven where God lives.

In scene one, God is in a position of authority and hearing the reports from his servants. God is portrayed as king in other stories, so when he meets his servants, he may be sitting on his throne. Then his many spirit servants are coming to where God was so they could report to him. Satan will be among the spirit servants. But only God and Satan will talk in the next scene.

In scene two, God will again tell Satan about Job's character. When God asks Satan if Satan had already considered Job, God was asking a question that is asked not to find an answer but to say something important. In this story, the important information is Job's character that God will reveal. God said that Satan incited him to deal harm against Job even though Job did not deserve it. Still, Job maintained his integrity. Satan will respond and propose that God should inflict harm on Job himself. Satan said that if God will harm Job's body, Job will surely curse God to his face. God will answer Satan. He will begin his response with a word that is intended to call the attention of Satan so he will listen to the important statement that he will make. In this context, the important information is God's response. God's answer to Satan is, "Behold, he is in your hands." God will agree to Satan's proposal, but Satan must not kill Job.

Stop the action: Ask the actor playing God, "How do you feel?" You may hear things like, "Having spirit servants reporting to me shows that I'm in control of everything that happens in the world" or "I wonder if Satan has considered Job my servant. I should ask him." Restart the action.

In scene two, God will ask Satan about Job. He'll describe Job his servant as blameless, upright, fearing God, and turning away from evil. No one in the world pleases God like Job. Satan will propose that God should inflict harm on Job's body. Satan was certain that if God will do this, Job will curse God to his face.

Stop the action: Ask the actor playing God, "How do you feel?" You may hear things like, "I am pleased that Job maintained his integrity even after he lost everything. In order to prove Satan wrong, I will accept his challenge, but he must see it for himself." or "I am sure that Job will maintain his integrity even if Satan will harm his body." Restart the action.

So, God agrees to Satan's challenge. He says that Satan may inflict harm on Job's body but he cannot kill Job.

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to the text once again in the easiest to understand version.

One day the **sons of God** came to present themselves before God. The sons of God refers to the spirit beings that were servants of God. As God had human servants, God had spirit servants as well. This shows that God is king on both heaven and on earth. It shows his power and control over everything that happens in the world. God's spirit servants were called sons of God, or angels as in other parts of the Bible. As servants, God gave them work to do and they were required to present themselves before God, or to report the progress of their work to God. Remember that the name of **God** used in this story is **Yahweh**, God's personal name except for the word "Son of God" and except for when God refers to himself. Your team should translate the personal name of God, Yahweh, in the same way you have in other stories and remember that Yahweh is in the Master Glossary.

**Satan** also came to present himself. In the Hebrew, Satan means enemy or accuser. Remember to translate it the way you have translated it in the previous passage. For more information about Satan, you may refer to the Master Glossary.

God begins the conversation with Satan. He asks Satan if Satan had seen his servant, Job. God said that there is no one like Job who is **blameless** and **upright**. He also **feared God** and **turned away from evil**. Remember to translate these words that describe Job the same way you have translated them in the previous story.

God also said that Satan incited him to destroy Job without reason. Yet Job maintained his **integrity**, which means that he remained upright and he did his best to avoid sin.

Satan said, "Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life. But stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will **curse you to your face**." Satan was telling God to inflict harm on Job's body so that Job would curse God. Cursing is when a person wishes for something unpleasant to happen to another person. Cursing God to his face is when a person speaks words or has thoughts that are against God. You may refer to the Master Glossary for more information about curse.

God accepts Satan's challenge and says, God said, "**Behold**, he is in your hands." Here, "behold" is an expression that is typically said before a very important statement. It is also translated as "Look!" It has the effect of slowing the flow of speech to prepare the reader or listener for an important statement. God also says, "Only spare his life." This expression means that God is not allowing Satan to kill Job.

## Job 2:7–13 (id: 877402)

Hear and Heart
--------------

Hear Job 2:7–13 and put it in your heart. Listen to the text three times (in three different translations, if possible). Then as a team discuss the following questions:

1. What do you like in this story?
2. What do you not like or not understand?
3. What does this story tell us about God?
4. What does this story tell us about people?
5. How does this story affect our daily life?
6. Who do you know who needs to hear this story?

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to the text once in the easiest to understand version.

The previous story told about the second conversation between God and Satan. God said that nobody was like his servant Job who was upright and feared God. Satan proposed to test Job by harming his body. God agreed and gave permission to Satan to inflict harm on Job's body. But Satan cannot kill Job.

In the present story, Satan agrees and goes out from God's presence. Then Satan gave Job a terrible skin disease that covered his body. It is unclear how Satan did this. The exact skin disease is also unclear, but based on the story, it may have caused Job wounds like deep cuts and sores on his skin, as well as itching. It also made Job difficult to recognize from a distance. Then Job took a piece of broken pottery which he used to scrape himself while he sat in a place where there were lots of ashes. **Ashes** are what is commonly left when an object is burned completely. Broken potteries and ashes were typically found in places where people throw and burn objects they don't use anymore.

Stop and show a picture of a broken pottery and ashes. In the ancient times, what Job did showed that a person is grieving because of a great tragedy. Job may have done this to show that he is grieving because of his condition.

Stop and discuss the following question: how do people in your culture show that they are grieving because of a great tragedy?

Job's wife is in the scene. Her name is not mentioned. After Job lost everything, now even Job is sick. So, in a form of a question, she says that Job should no longer keep his **integrity**. Job's integrity refers to his blameless, upright character that fears God and turns away evil. She tells Job to **curse God**, or to speak evil words against God so that God will kill him, and then he will die. In ancient times, people commonly thought that if a person angers God, God will kill him.

Job answers his wife and says that his wife is speaking like a **foolish** woman. A person is foolish when he fails to accept God's control over his life. By telling him to curse God and die, Job said that his wife is speaking like God is not watching and caring over their lives. In a form of a question, Job tells his wife that they should receive both **good** and **evil** from God. Here, good refers to the blessings that Job used to have, and evil refers to the bad things that happened to Job. This is similar to Job's response after his first tragedy. When Job lost everything, Job accepted all his losses and affirmed God's control over his life. He said that if God can give him blessings, God can certainly take them away as he wishes. In the same way, if God can give him good things, God can certainly allow bad things to happen to him if he wishes. Despite all these things, Job did not **sin** with his lips. Meaning, Job did not say evil words against God.

Job's three friends came to Job when they heard the evil things that happened to him. Here, evil refers to the bad things that happened to Job. Job's three friends were Eliphaz who is from the city of Teman, Bildad who is from the land of Shua, and Zophar from the land of Naamah. The exact location of these places is unknown. They planned together to come to **sympathize** and **comfort** Job. They wanted to make Job feel that he was not alone as he grieves for all the bad things that happened to him.

When they saw Job from a distance, they could not recognize him, likely because of the severe skin disease that covered his whole body. When they came to Job, they cried loudly, tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads towards heaven. When Job's friends sprinkled dust into the air over their heads, they are showing that they want to share in Job's suffering so that Job's suffering would somehow be lessened. Job's suffering was so great that his friends could not leave him alone. So, they sat with him for seven days, and they did not talk to him. All of these were ancient practices that people did when they were mourning. People did this too when it happened to someone who was very close to them.

Stop and discuss the following question: how do people in your culture comfort or sympathize with people who are mourning after they experienced great tragedies?

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to the text once again in the easiest to understand version.

In this session, you will help the group visualize this story. You will help the group define the scenes, setting, and characters of the story.

This story has three scenes.

**First Scene:** Satan will strike Job with terrible skin disease. Job's body will be covered in a skin disease. Job will go to a place where there are broken potteries and ashes. He will sit on the ashes. Then he will scrape his body using the broken pottery around him.

**Second Scene:** Job's wife will go to where Job is. In a form of a question, she will tell Job to give up his integrity by cursing God so God will kill him. But Job's response will be to tell her that she should not speak that way. Because of her wife's words, Job will tell her wife that she is speaking like a foolish woman that does not recognize God's power over their lives. In a form of question, Job will tell his wife that they should accept both good such as blessings, and evil such as bad things that make life difficult. Because both good and evil come from God.

**Third Scene:** Job's three friends will first meet and talk among themselves. They heard about Job's suffering so that they will agree to visit Job and comfort him. When they go to where Job is, they will see Job from afar. But they will not recognize Job until they come closer. When they see Job, they will cry loudly, tear the robes, and sprinkle dust toward the heavens, and the dust will land on their heads. Then they will sit with Job silently for seven days.

The characters in this story include:

* Satan
* Job
* Job's wife
* Eliphaz
* Bildad
* Zophar

In this session, have the group storyboard, draw out, or use some sort of manipulatives to visualize the story and the action in it.

The previous story was set in heaven where God lives. The setting of the present story is again back on earth where Job is.

In scene one, be sure to show that Satan went from heaven to earth. Show also that it was Satan who will give the disease to Job. Job's skin disease must cover his whole body. Job's appearance should change so that his friends will not recognize him from a distance. You may use any object that may represent the broken pottery that Job used to scrape his skin. We know that Job was suffering, so be sure to show Job as showing pain.

Scene two begins with a word that shows that it continues right after the previous scene. So, Job's wife will enter while Job is scraping his skin seated on the ashes. The exact feelings that Job's wife felt is unclear. She may be portrayed as either worried or angry at Job because Job was still keeping his integrity. Job will answer his wife using a question that he does not expect an answer to. Job wants to make an important statement. Here, Job's important statement is about God as both the one who gives and the who takes away.

In scene three, be sure to show the great surprise and sadness that the three friends will have when they see Job. They will cry loudly and tear their clothes to pieces. They will sit silently on the ashes with Job for seven days.

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to the text once again in the easiest to understand version.

In this session, the team will dramatize the story.

This story has three scenes.

The characters in this story include:

* Satan
* Job
* Job's wife
* Eliphaz
* Bildad
* Zophar

Have the team act out the story twice. They should act it out in the language they are translating into. First, have the team act out the story without stopping. The second time the team acts out the story, stop them at different points in the story.

As the team acts out the story the first time, pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the story. Look out for the important or difficult parts of the story or passage to be acted out and not skipped. Help the team remember parts of the story.

The second time the team acts out this story, stop them at certain points.

In scene one, Satan will strike Job with a skin disease that will cover his whole body. Job will suffer greatly. He will scrape his skin and sit on the ashes to show that he is grieving because of his suffering.

Stop the action: Ask the actor playing Satan, "How do you feel?" You may hear things like, "Now I'm sure that Job will curse God to his face!" or "If Job will not curse God after this, that must mean that I'm wrong and God was right. Job is truly blameless, upright, fearing God and turning away from evil!" Ask also the actor playing Job, "How do you feel?" You may hear things like, "My skin hurts!" or "Even though I'm suffering from this disease, I will not curse God to his face!" Restart the action.

In scene two, Job and his wife will talk. His wife tells Job to give up his integrity by cursing God so God will kill him.

Stop the action: Ask the actor playing Job, "How do you feel?" You may hear things like, "I'm disappointed with my wife because she is speaking like a foolish woman!" or "Both good things and bad things come from God. We must accept both. I will not curse God to his face!" Restart the action.

In scene three, Job's friends will come and see Job.

Stop the action: Ask the actor playing Eliphaz, "How do you feel?" You may hear things like, "I don't recognize Job because of the skin disease that covers his whole body!" Ask also Bildad, "How do you feel?" You may hear things like, "We should cry loudly, tear our clothes and sprinkle dust on our heads. Perhaps we may share in his suffering and his suffering will be lighter." Ask also Zophar, "How do you feel?" You may hear things like, "Job is suffering greatly. We cannot leave him alone. We will stay with him silently for seven days."

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to the text once again in the easiest to understand version.

The present story shows how Satan inflicted a terrible skin disease on Job. Remember that in the previous story, God and Satan agreed to test Job's integrity.

In the story, Satan **struck** Job with a **terrible skin disease**. This expression means that Satan did something so that Job suddenly had a terrible skin disease. The exact skin disease is unclear. But according to the story, it made Job suffer greatly. To mourn over his condition, Job scraped his skin with a piece of broken pottery while he sat in a place where there were **ashes** around him. Ashes are what is left when some objects are burned completely. They look like dust, but they are lighter than dust so that wind can carry them away easily. What Job did was a common practice in the ancient times to show that a person was mourning.

In a form of a question, Job's wife will tell him that he should no longer **hold fast** to his **integrity**. This is another way of saying that Job should give up his blameless and upright character. Job should no longer fear God, and turn away from evil. Job's wife will also tell Job to **curse God** so that God will kill him. Cursing is when a person wishes for something unpleasant to happen to another person. Cursing God is when a person speaks words or has thoughts that are against God. You may refer to the Master Glossary for more information about curse.

Job responded to his wife and said that she is speaking like a **foolish** woman. In the Old Testament, a person is a fool when he speaks or behaves without thinking carefully or without considering that God is watching over his life. The opposite of a foolish person is a wise person. A wise person is a person that thinks carefully and considers God watching over him every time he speaks or behaves. By telling him to curse God and die, Job said that his wife is speaking like God is not watching and caring for them. In a form of a question, Job adds that they must accept both **good** and **evil** as coming from God. Here, **good** refers to the blessings that God gives while **evil** refers to the bad things that often result in suffering. Job says that both good and evil are in God's control. By saying this, Job did not sin with his lips. This is another way of saying that Job did not speak evil words against God.

Job's friends will meet and agree to **sympathize** and **comfort** Job. Sympathize and comfort are actions that a person does to another person that is mourning or suffering. Job's friends did this in several ways. First, they raised their voices and wept, which means they cried loudly. Then, they tore their robes or their clothes. Then, they sprinkled dust toward heaven so it would land on their heads. This is a way to show that they want to share in Job's suffering so that Job's suffering would somehow be lessened. Then, they sat silently with Job among the ashes for seven days.

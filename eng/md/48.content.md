Setting the Stage

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 1:1–5 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

This passage is the beginning of a message from Paul to the believers in Galatia. Earlier, Paul and another believer, Barnabas, visited several cities in this region. There, Paul and Barnabas told people the good news about Jesus. Though the Romans owned these cities, several different people groups lived in the cities, including Jewish people and Gentiles, or non\-Jewish people. Many Jewish people were angry about what Paul taught, but many people believed in Jesus, especially the Gentile people. Eventually, the unbelieving Jews forced Paul and Barnabas to leave the cities in Galatia, but groups of believers or churches remained in each city. Paul cared about the believers in those cities and had already returned once to visit these believers.

Stop here and look at a map of the region of Galatia as a group. Find the cities Paul visited, which are Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. Pause this audio here.

Now Paul is in another city where Paul has heard that something bad is happening in the Galatian cities. People are telling the Galatians that believers must also follow Jewish laws. This is not what Paul taught the Galatians when Paul came and told the Galatians the good news about Jesus. Other people are now saying that they know more than Paul does and that their version of the good news is better than what Paul taught. Paul writes to the Galatians to remind the Galatians of the truth about Jesus.

Paul knows what kinds of things these other teachers are saying, so Paul begins by reminding the Galatian believers of who Paul is and what authority Paul has. Paul is an apostle, or someone whom Jesus himself chose to preach the good news and help believers learn about God. Paul clarifies that human beings did not choose Paul or give authority to Paul. Though the believers in Antioch sent Paul to the Galatians, the believers in Antioch did not choose Paul. Jesus Christ and God the Father chose Paul. Then the Holy Spirit told this to the believers at Antioch. God the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit worked together to choose Paul.

God is the Father of Jesus Christ, and God is the Father of the people God adopted into God's family because those people trusted in Christ. God the Father showed how powerful he was when he caused Jesus to live again. Paul's opponents may have claimed that they had more authority than Paul had, but God gave Paul authority, and God has the most authority! Paul is right to correct the believers because of this authority.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when a leader chose you to be in charge of a group of people. How did you tell the group of people that you had the authority or right to lead those people? Pause this audio here.

Paul and the brothers, or the other believers who are with Paul, send a greeting to the Galatian believers. Paul also may mention these other believers to show that these believers think in the same way or feel the same concerns that Paul will later talk about in this letter. Paul then says that this letter is to the churches or groups of believers in Galatia. Since Galatia is a region with several cities in it, the believers will probably share this letter with the groups of believers in the other cities.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Imagine your leader or king sent a very important message to the people in your region. How would the leader send the message? How would the leader make sure that everyone heard the message? Pause this audio here.

Paul uses a common greeting among believers that is also a prayer. Paul asks God to give the believers grace or to be kind to the believers, even though people do not deserve it. Paul also asks God to give the believers peace or to give them well\-being in all parts of their lives and relationships. God gives believers both of these. God is both God the Father and Jesus Christ. Jesus is the believers' Lord or master, as well as the Christ, which means savior.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, how do you greet one another? When you send a message to someone who lives far away, how do you greet that person? Pause this audio here.

Believers can have this grace and peace because of what God did. Jesus willingly died to save people from their sins or from the punishment for the way those people disobey God. Jesus died to save the people from the present evil age. Paul is referring to the evil or bad period of time in which believers lived. Paul is also referring to the evil way that people lived during this period. The world and everyone in it belongs to God, and God rules over everything. But the present time is evil since people do not treat God as king. Instead, people serve evil powers, things, and people. One day, Jesus will return, and everyone will know that God is king.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, how do you talk about periods of time? As an activity, discuss some times in your people's history when people's lives were good and calm, like when you had a good king or leader. Also, think of some times in your people's history when people's lives were not easy or calm, like when your people fought each other. What made those times good or bad for people? How do you talk about the way that it was good or bad? Pause this audio here.

But Jesus has set the believers free so that the believers do not have to live like people do in this present evil age. When Jesus did that, Jesus obeyed what God, who is our Father, wanted. Again, Paul shows how God the Father and Jesus, who is God, work together to save us. Paul will later explain in this letter that since Jesus has already rescued the believers, believers do not need to add anything to what Jesus did or do anything more for Jesus to save them. The believers do not need to follow certain laws in order to please God enough. Jesus has already saved and freed the believers!

This is such good news that Paul praises God for what God has done. God is always glorious, great, or magnificent. Paul praises God when Paul says this, and Paul emphasizes how true this is when Paul says "amen."

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, how do you praise God? When are some times when you would praise God while you are talking to someone else?

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 1:1–5 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has two parts.

**In the first part:** Paul explains that this letter is from Paul and that Paul is an apostle because God the Father and Jesus Christ chose Paul.

**In the second part:** Paul and Paul's fellow believers greet the believers in Galatia and ask that God the Father and Jesus will give the Galatian believers grace and peace. Paul praises God for what God has done.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Lord Jesus Christ
* God the Father
* The believers with Paul
* And the believers in the churches in Galatia

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

This passage is the beginning of the letter from Paul to the believers in the region of Galatia. In that time, people would often write letters by speaking out loud to someone else who wrote the letter down. The person would decide what they wanted to say and then tell someone else what to write down. Paul would often work with a group of people to write a letter. It is possible that the group of believers who sent greetings with the letter helped Paul, but Paul does not specifically mention whether anyone chose the words with Paul for this letter.

After Paul finished this letter, someone took the letter to the people who needed to hear these words. This person might have held the written letter in their hands when they read it to the church, but the person would know the words of the letter well and would be ready to say everything in it. Sometimes, the person with the letter would take the letter to several places. Whoever brought this letter to the region of Galatia probably traveled around to the cities Paul had visited to share the letter with the believers there.

Paul begins this letter as Paul and other people in that time would normally begin letters. Paul explains who the letter is from, then says who the letter is to. After that, Paul greets the people Paul writes to with a wish for their well\-being. For the believers, this wish was often a prayer. Paul would often encourage the believers or thank God for the believers in this part of Paul's letters. However, Paul does not do that here! Paul is worried about the Galatians. Paul is concerned about the problems the Galatians have. This shorter introduction shows that Paul wants to begin to talk about the problems quickly!

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Discuss the way you normally send a message to someone who lives far away. What do people usually include in a message? Now imagine you send an urgent or important message because you are worried about someone. What would you say differently in this message? Pause this audio here.

In this passage, Paul introduces the things that Paul will later talk about in the letter. Paul states that it was God and Jesus, not people, who chose Paul to be an apostle. Paul has very strong authority because God chose Paul. Thus, Paul is the right person to correct the Galatian believers. Paul also reminds the Galatians that Jesus saved believers when Jesus died for our sins. The main idea of this whole letter to the Galatians is that God saves us when we believe in Jesus. We do not do anything to earn this. If anyone says anything different, that person is wrong!

In the first part of this passage, Paul introduces himself. Paul emphasizes that Paul's authority and the gospel Paul talks about are from God, not people. Paul does this because people question Paul and what Paul has said. But Paul shows here that Paul is not just sharing his opinion. Paul is telling the Galatians to listen to what God has told Paul to say!

Paul says both Jesus Christ and God the Father worked together to send Paul. Paul calls Jesus the title of Christ, which means the person whom God had chosen and promised to send as king and savior. Jesus appeared to Paul, which may be why Paul mentions Jesus first here. Jesus was able to appear to Paul because God the Father raised Jesus back to life. This is the same powerful God who chose Paul! When referring to God, Paul would often talk about what God has done, especially in or through Jesus Christ. Paul does this to show who God is and what God does. Paul will do this again in the next part of this passage.

Now that Paul has shown who Paul is and why he is an apostle, Paul greets the believers in Galatia. In this second part, Paul says that both Paul and the believers with Paul ask that God give the Galatian believers grace and peace. Paul calls his fellow believers "brothers" because the believers are all a part of God's family. God is our Father because God has adopted the believers into God's family. God already loves the believers as his children. The believers do not have to do anything else to earn this love.

Stop here and discuss as a group: Here, Paul calls the believers his "brothers." Paul will call the Galatian believers "brothers and sisters" several times in this letter to show that Paul loves the believers and that all the believers are like one family together, with God as their father. What do you call each other as believers? What would be a good title to use in Galatians for fellow believers, both men and women? Pause this audio here.

Paul also calls Christ "Lord," which means master. People would use the title "Lord" for God, and Paul often calls Jesus "Lord" to remind the believers that Jesus is God too. Again, Paul talks about what God our Father and Jesus Christ have done, this time to give us grace and peace. Paul talks about three things Jesus did. First, Jesus willingly died to save us from our sins, or the way we disobey God. Paul says that Jesus gave himself or chose to die to rescue us. When Jesus rescued us, Jesus set us free from danger. Second, Jesus sets us free from this present evil age or the evil way that people live. And third, Jesus was obedient to the will of God the Father, which means that Jesus obeyed what God the Father wanted Jesus to do. Because of this, Paul says that glory belongs to God forever. God has always been glorious or great and always will be. To emphasize that, Paul says "amen," which is a word people say to mean "Yes, indeed," or "That is the way it should be."

Stop here and discuss how you want to talk about the present evil age, or the evil way that people live. As an activity, describe a good time in your life when people were kind to you and a bad time in your life when people were not kind. Pay attention to what words or phrases you use to talk about a bad time. Pause this audio here.

Discuss this question as a group: In your language, how do people emphasize something important? What words do you say that mean "Yes, indeed," or "That is the way it should be"? Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Embodying the Text

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 1:1–5 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has two parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Lord Jesus Christ
* God the Father
* The believers with Paul
* And the believers in the churches in Galatia

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "This letter is from me, Paul. I am an apostle. People did not choose me to be an apostle. Jesus did not tell someone to send me. Instead, Jesus Christ and God the Father chose me. God the Father caused Jesus to live again. I and all the fellow believers who are with me send this letter to you who are in the churches in the region of Galatia."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I care about the believers in the region of Galatia. Even though I am not near those believers anymore, I still think about those believers and want to talk to them; or
* I am honored that God chose me to be an apostle. I want the Galatians to remember that God chose me. I do not want the Galatians to honor me more than others or treat me better than anyone else, because I am an apostle. I want the Galatians to remember this so the Galatians can know that what I say is from God, so it is true; or
* I hope the believers listen to what I have to say. It is very important that the believers do not start to believe in something that cannot save the believers. I will show the believers that the truth is important in the way that I write this letter.

Ask the person playing God the Father, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I know that the Galatians hear different messages and are confused. I will tell Paul to write to the Galatians to help them understand what is true. I do not want my people to believe lies which will hurt them; or
* I know the believers will hear many confusing things as the believers try to obey me. That is why I want the believers to learn together and keep communicating so that the believers can remind each other of what is true; or
* I want people to remember who I am and what I do so that people can remember that I am reliable and powerful. People should listen to me because I am God.

Continue the drama.

Paul says, "May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be kind to you and cause you to have peace. Jesus Christ willingly died to pay for our sins in order to free us from the evil that is now on the earth. Jesus Christ did this to obey God our Father, who is great forever. Amen."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing the Galatian believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* Paul is being polite at the beginning of this letter, but it sounds like Paul is quickly finishing the greetings so Paul can say something that he really wants to talk about. I wonder what Paul has to tell us; or
* I am thankful that Paul is writing to us. I have heard some things that confuse me, and I want to know what is true.

Ask the person playing Christ Jesus, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I willingly died because I love people. I want my people to have good relationships and peace with God and with the people around them; or
* I do not want people to live in the ways that they used to live. Those ways were evil and hurt people and the people around them; or
* I love God the Father and know that he only wants right and good things. We always work together in the best way.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 1:1–5 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul is an apostle. An apostle is someone who received special authority from Jesus to speak on Jesus' behalf. Apostles tell people that Jesus really rose from the dead, preach the gospel to all people, and have authority in the church.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **apostle**. Look up apostle in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Jesus Christ and God the Father chose Paul to be an apostle. Christ is a title for Jesus that reminds the believers that Jesus is the Messiah, or the savior and king whom God chose to come and rescue people.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **Christ**. Look up Christ in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul calls the believers with him "brothers." Since God is the Father of all believers, all believers are like brothers and sisters. So Paul often uses the word for brother when Paul refers to a fellow believer. When there is more than one brother, the word can also mean brothers and sisters.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **brothers**. Look up believer in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

This letter is to the churches in the region of Galatia. In the Bible, people never use the word "church" to mean a building. Instead, the church is a community of people who believe in Jesus. Sometimes the word church means all the people on earth together who believe in Jesus, but sometimes the word means a group of believers in a specific place, like it does here.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **churches**. Look up church in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul prays that God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will give grace and peace to the believers. God gives believers grace when God is kind to believers, even though they do not deserve it.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **grace**. Look up grace in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

God gives believers peace or harmony with himself and with each other. When people live in peace, those people are completely well. Those people have a complete life, and are living in harmony with each other, with nature, and most importantly, with God!

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **peace**. Look up peace in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul calls Jesus "Lord." A lord is a master over other people, who has full authority, so the Israelites used this word for God because God has authority over the whole world. Paul often called Jesus Lord to remind people that Jesus is God too.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **Lord**. Look up Lord in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Jesus Christ willingly died to save people from their sins. Sin is an act of rebellion against God. God has made good laws, and if people follow these laws, then people will be able to live together in peace. But people constantly break God's laws, and when they do, they sin.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **sin**. Look up sin in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Jesus Christ rescued believers from the present evil age. Evil is the opposite of good. Paul uses the phrase "evil age" to refer to the evil period of time in which believers live and to the evil way that people lived during this period.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **evil**. Look up evil in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul praises God when Paul says all glory belongs to God forever. Glory is the fame and admiration that people give you when you do something impressive. When God shows his glory, people can see how beautiful, powerful, and majestic God is. God deserves for everyone and everything to admire him because everything God does is impressive.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **glory**. Look up glory in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

After Paul praises God, Paul says, "Amen." Amen is a Hebrew word. Amen can mean something like, "I accept this," "May it be true," "Indeed," or "Truly."

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **amen**. Look up amen in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there.

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 1:6–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In the last passage, Paul began his letter and greeted the Galatians. Now, in this passage, Paul immediately begins to talk about the Galatians' problem. The Galatian believers listen to people who teach a message that is not the good news about Jesus. This good news about Jesus is that God saves people because of what Jesus did. All a person has to do is trust in Jesus. But these people teach a different message. Paul strongly warns the Galatians how wrong that is. Paul declares that Paul tries to honor or please God when Paul says this.

To begin this passage, Paul says that Paul is surprised and upset by what the Galatians are doing. Just a short time ago, Paul had told the Galatians the good news, and the Galatians believed in Christ. But now the Galatians are turning away from or are no longer loyal to God. God had called or chosen the Galatians to experience the grace of Christ. Grace is Christ's kindness to people who do not deserve that kindness. God calls people because of Christ's grace or kindness to people, so some translations say "by grace," or through grace. Paul had expected the Galatian believers to continue to believe both God and the gospel, which is the good news about Jesus. But instead, the Galatians have started to reject God and the gospel! This is hard for Paul to hear.

The Galatian believers are listening to other teachers. These teachers say they are believers who teach the gospel. But these teachers teach a message that is different from the gospel, so these teachers do not really teach the gospel at all. These teachers are troubling or confusing the Galatian believers, so that the Galatian believers no longer have the peace that God gives to believers. These teachers pervert or deliberately change the message about Christ.

In very strong language, Paul now warns the Galatians not to believe anyone who teaches a message different from what Paul preached or taught when Paul was in Galatia. No one may change the gospel—not Paul nor even an angel. An angel is a messenger from heaven where God lives. Paul curses anyone who pretends to teach the good news but is really teaching something different. When people curse someone, those people ask God to judge or punish that person.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what do people believe about angels or messengers from God? What are those messengers supposed to do? Where do people believe that angels come from? Pause this audio here.

Paul is showing how important the gospel is. No one should listen to or teach anything other than the truth. Paul has already told the Galatian believers this, probably when Paul was with the Galatians. The Galatians know the truth and have accepted it as true, so the Galatians should not listen to anything different from that truth. If someone teaches a message that is different from the good news, that person is telling others to believe a message that cannot help anyone.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what do people believe about curses? In your culture, why would someone curse another person? Paul strongly warns the Galatians with this curse. How would you strongly warn someone not to do something? Pause this audio here.

Paul is not worried about trying to please people, so Paul speaks strongly against people who teach a message that is different than the good news. Paul does not care if people are surprised or think that Paul speaks too strongly. Paul is worried about the truth and wants people to see how important the gospel is! Paul talks in this way because Paul wants to please God. Paul serves Christ, so Paul's goal is not to please people. Paul calls himself a servant of Christ to show that Paul works reliably for Christ and that Paul's authority is from Christ. Paul is assuring the Galatians that what Paul teaches is true because Paul does and says what Christ tells Paul to.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Describe someone whom a leader has chosen to lead a group and who is very devoted to doing and saying what their leader would want. What are some titles you would call that person? What titles would that person call themselves?

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 1:6–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul says that Paul is surprised and disappointed that the Galatian believers listen to people who teach something that is not the gospel.

**In the second part:** Paul curses those who say they teach about Jesus, but instead teach a message that is not the gospel.

**In the third part:** Paul explains why Paul speaks so harshly. Paul is not trying to cause people to like Paul. Paul wants to please God and do what God says is right because Paul is Christ's servant.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* Christ
* People who teach a false message that is not the gospel
* The believers with Paul
* An angel from heaven
* And God

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

When Paul writes a letter, Paul usually greets the believers he writes to and then prays and thanks God for those believers. But in this letter, Paul has no time for that! The Galatians are in danger because the Galatians are listening to a message that is not the good news. At this point, the Galatians have not completely stopped believing the good news that Paul has taught them. But the Galatian believers are starting to change how they think and act. Paul knows this, so Paul immediately begins to talk about the Galatians' problem.

In the first part, Paul says that Paul is surprised and upset about how the Galatian believers are acting. Not long ago, the Galatians believed the good news, but now the Galatians are rejecting the one who called the Galatians. The one who called the Galatians is God. God called or invited the Galatians to be his people. But the Galatians are deserting God, like a person leaves one group to join another group.

God called the Galatians by or through the grace of Christ. Grace is the kindness of God through Jesus Christ. God shows this kindness when God saves believers and continues to show kindness to believers as they believe in Jesus. So here, Paul could be talking about the way that God called the Galatians to become believers because Christ wanted to be kind to the Galatians. Or Paul could mean the way God calls believers to experience Christ's grace and kindness as believers. Different translations will often have one of these two wordings because both of these things are true.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How have you heard this portion where Paul talks about the way that God called the Galatians? What version would people in your area be familiar with? Discuss how you want to translate this portion. Pause this audio here.

Paul says the Galatians listen to a different gospel. Paul does not mean that there are different versions of the good news. Paul clarifies that a different gospel is not really the gospel at all. The only right gospel is the gospel about Christ. Some people probably say that the Galatians do not know all of the real gospel and that these people have the rest of the information. These people say they teach the gospel, but these people really teach something different. These people lie about Christ and confuse the Galatians.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Paul calls this other message a false gospel, because it is not the gospel at all. Talk about how you want to discuss a false item, or something that people claim is real but is not. As an activity, have someone show an item, like a flower, and describe it to the others in the group. Then have someone show a different object, like a rock, but call it a flower and describe it like a flower. How would you refer to the way the second person talks about their object? Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul talks harshly about those people who preach another message. Paul curses those people. This means that Paul asks God to punish or condemn those people. Even though Paul uses strong language, this is an appropriate response. God himself has said he will punish people who try to lie about what God has said. Paul curses those people twice to show how wrong it is to teach a lie about Jesus. The first time, Paul emphasizes his curse by stating a situation that was not real. Neither Paul nor the believers with Paul had preached a different gospel to the Galatians. To preach means to teach people about the gospel. When Paul says "we" here, Paul could mean only Paul himself, or Paul and the believers with Paul. And an angel from heaven would never tell people something to change the good news. If a person or an angel did that, then God would punish that person or angel. The second time Paul asks God to curse people, Paul is talking about the people who currently lie about the gospel. As Paul curses people who teach lies, Paul also reminds the Galatian believers that they know the truth and have believed that truth.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how would someone rightly curse another person for doing something wrong? Discuss how you want to translate Paul's curses. Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how do you talk about heaven, or the place where God lives? Pause this audio here.

When Paul curses people who teach lies, Paul also warns people who listen to these people who teach lies. If God is not pleased with those who teach lies, then God will not be pleased with those who believe lies either. And this is not the first time Paul has said this! Paul and the believers who were with Paul in Galatia have already told the Galatians this. Paul is trying to show the Galatians how important it is to only share the true gospel.

In the third part, Paul asks several questions that Paul does not expect people to answer. Paul is emphasizing that Paul is not trying to win the approval of people. Paul's opponents may say that Paul tells people they do not have to follow certain rules just so people will like Paul. Before Paul became a believer, Paul did try to please people and to follow the rules that people now tell the Galatian believers to do. But then Paul became a servant of Christ and discovered that Paul no longer needed to follow those rules. So now Paul tries to please God instead of people. If Paul was still trying to please people, then Paul could not be a servant of Christ. But Paul is a servant of Christ, so Paul wants to please God.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How would you describe the way that a person cares deeply about what other people think and feel about that person? How would you describe the way that a person cares deeply about what God thinks and feels about that person? Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 1:6–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* Christ
* People who teach a false message that is not the gospel
* The believers with Paul
* An angel from heaven
* And God

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "I am very surprised that you so quickly reject God. God invited you to experience Christ's grace. But now you are accepting a different message. People say this different message is the gospel, but there really is no other gospel! Those people cause you trouble and want to change the good news about Christ."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am surprised because I thought the Galatians would continue to believe in Jesus. When I was there, the Galatians said they would! or
* I am disappointed that the Galatians do not know the difference between the truth and a lie; or
* I am sad that the Galatians are listening to people who trouble and confuse the Galatians. When the believers listen to things that are not true, the believers do not have peace. I want the believers to have peace!

Continue the drama.

Paul says, "I pray that God will punish anyone who preaches anything different from our message to you! It does not matter if that person is one of us or an angel from heaven. I say again what we have said before: I pray that God will punish anyone who teaches you a message that is not the same good news that you believed."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing the Galatian believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* Wow, I am surprised how harshly Paul speaks! This must be important; or
* I did not realize how bad it was to listen to this other message. I thought it was similar to what Paul taught us; or
* I felt confused and concerned when I listened to the other message. I did not understand how that message could be true.

Ask the person playing God, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* Lies and messages that are not the gospel hurt people. I care about people and do not want people to be confused or hurt because they believe lies; or
* I am angry when people teach a different message than my gospel. When people teach something different, they say that I am a liar and that they know better than I do. This is not true, and it insults me; or
* I do not try to confuse people by sending angels with different messages that do not make sense. I will tell people hard things, but those things will always be true and consistent.

Continue the drama.

Paul says, "When I speak like this, I am not trying to please people. I want to please God. I am not trying to get people to praise me, because if I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I know God loves me and cares for me like a father does. I want to honor and please him! or
* People's opinions change, and sometimes people think things that are wrong. God is always right, so I care what God thinks of me, not what people think; or
* I am honored to be Christ's servant. I want to serve and obey Christ because I love Christ.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 1:6–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

God called the believers in the **grace** of Christ. Grace is when someone is kind to someone who does not deserve that kindness. God gives believers grace when God is kind to believers, even though they do not deserve that kindness. For more information on grace, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for grace as you used in previous passages.

**Christ** is a title for Jesus that reminds the believers that Jesus is the Messiah, or the savior and king that God chose to come and rescue people. For more information on Christ, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Christ as you used in previous passages.

The Galatians are believing a message that is not the gospel. The word gospel is a translation of a Greek word that literally means "good news." The good news in the Bible is that God has made a way to save people. The good news that Paul told the Galatians is that God will save the Galatians if they trust in Jesus.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **gospel**. Look up gospel in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul preached the gospel to the Galatians when Paul was in Galatia. When people preach, they evangelize or teach the good news about Jesus.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **preach**. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul curses anyone who tries to change the message of the gospel. When you curse someone, you wish that something bad will happen to that person. People believed that a curse would come true. Paul is specifically asking God to punish these people.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **curse**. Look up curse in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Not even an angel from heaven should change the gospel. An angel is a supernatural, spiritual being whom God created. Angels give messages from God to people. Sometimes an angel seems to look like a normal person, but at other times, angels can look very bright and shining or even frightening.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **angel**. Look up angel in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Here, heaven refers to the place where God lives with his angels. This heaven is not somewhere in this universe; it is not a place that humans can travel to. But God can send his angels from heaven to earth to do God's work.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **heaven**. Look up heaven in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul says that Paul does not try to please people because Paul is a servant of Christ. A servant is a person who does work for someone else. When Paul calls himself this, Paul shows that Paul is a humble follower of Christ and also that Paul's authority is from Christ.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **servant**. Look up servant in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 1:11–24 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In the last passage, Paul called himself a servant of Christ. Now, Paul tells the story of how Paul became a servant of Christ. God chose Paul and gave Paul the gospel that Paul teaches. No human being taught the gospel to Paul, not even the apostles. Because the gospel Paul teaches is from God and not from imperfect people, that gospel is reliable, and the Galatians should listen to Paul, who teaches that gospel.

To start this passage, Paul shows his love for the believers when Paul calls the believers brothers and sisters. Though Paul is upset at what the Galatians are doing, Paul still cares for the Galatians. That is why Paul is writing this letter—to help the Galatians! Paul reassures the Galatians that humans, who can make mistakes, did not make up the gospel. No person told or taught Paul the good news that Paul taught to the Galatians. Instead, Paul received a revelation of Jesus Christ. Revelation is when God reveals or makes known something that people did not know or see before. Although Paul already knew about Jesus, God directly showed Paul who Jesus really was. God did this when Jesus appeared to Paul on the way to the city of Damascus. Since Jesus appeared to Paul, some translations say that the revelation was from Jesus. Other translations say that the revelation was about Jesus, since Paul learned about Jesus at that moment.

Then Paul tells the story of what Paul was like before Paul knew who Jesus really was. Paul had probably told the Galatians what Paul had done as a Jew who strongly devoted himself to God. When Paul had worshiped God as the Jews worship God, Paul had hated the believers. Paul tried to stop anyone from believing in Jesus. Paul attacked the church because Paul was so devoted to the Jewish religion. Paul had learned more about the Jewish religion than most of the other men his age. And Paul eagerly obeyed Paul's ancestors' traditions, or the teachings that people teach to their descendants. Paul was so devoted to the Jewish religion that only God could have changed Paul.

And God did change Paul! Before Paul was even born, God had chosen Paul to do God's work. Though Paul did not deserve it, God showed kindness to Paul when God invited Paul to be an apostle. God did this when God revealed who God's Son is to Paul. God wants and likes to show people who God's son, Jesus, is. Jesus is the Son of God because Jesus has a special relationship with God the Father. God and Jesus love each other in the way that a father and a son love each other. And Paul did not just see Jesus. God caused Paul to understand that Jesus really is the Savior, Lord, and Son of God. God did this so that Paul could tell the news about God's Son to the Gentiles, who are the non\-Jewish people.

After God did this, Paul did not go to anyone to ask how to teach the good news. Paul did not go to the apostles who were in the city of Jerusalem. The apostles were leaders, and people may have expected Paul to go to the apostles to learn the gospel and how to teach it. But Paul did not need humans to confirm or explain the gospel to Paul because God had already done that.

Stop here and look at a map that shows the city of Jerusalem in the region of Judea. Pause this audio here.

Instead, Paul goes to the region of Arabia and the nearby city of Damascus. There, Paul immediately begins to teach about Jesus! Arabia and Damascus are both far from Jerusalem. There were no apostles in Arabia and Damascus, so God was teaching Paul and leading Paul there.

Stop here and look at a map of Judea and the surrounding lands as a group. Find the region of Arabia and the city of Damascus. Pause this audio here.

It is not until three years after God reveals Christ to Paul that Paul goes to Jerusalem. Even in Jerusalem, Paul's visit is short, so the apostles could not have taught Paul everything about Jesus. In fact, Paul only visits two of the leaders there. Paul gets to know Cephas, whose name is also Peter. Peter was one of Jesus's disciples. Peter and Paul would have talked about Jesus, but Paul did not learn everything about Jesus from Peter. Paul also meets James, the brother of the Lord Jesus. This is a different James than two of Jesus' disciples, whose names were also James. Except for James and Peter, Paul does not see any of the other apostles.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: The names Cephas and Peter both have the same meaning in different languages, so people would use these two names to refer to the same man. Think of some names that mean the same things in different languages. Discuss whether anyone you know has more than one name that people call that person. Why do people call that person different names? Pause this audio here.

Paul assures the Galatians with an oath that God knows that what Paul writes is not a lie. In this time, people would often swear an oath to emphasize that what they said was really true. In the next part of his story, Paul continues to show that people did not teach Paul about the gospel. Again, Paul goes to two more regions that are far from Jerusalem, where there are no apostles to teach Paul. This time, Paul visits parts of the regions of Syria and Cilicia. The cities of Tarsus and Antioch are in these regions. Paul continues to preach the good news in those regions.

Stop here and look at a map of Judea and the surrounding lands as a group. Find the regions of Syria and Cilicia, as well as the cities of Tarsus and Antioch. Pause this audio here.

Because Paul was in these faraway regions, Paul was not able to get to know the groups of believers in the region of Judea, where Jerusalem is. Believers had heard of Paul, especially since Paul had previously attacked the believers. However, now the believers hear stories about that man, Paul, who had attacked believers. The believers hear that Paul now teaches about the faith, which is the good news about Jesus! This is such good news that the believers in Judea praise God for changing Paul and working through Paul to spread the faith. These believers in Judea know that Paul teaches the true gospel, even though they did not meet or choose Paul. These believers trust that God has taught Paul. Paul wants the Galatians to also trust that God has taught Paul!

Stop here and find the region of Judea and the surrounding lands on the map.

Defining the Scenes

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 1:11–24 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has four parts.

**In the first part:** Paul says firmly that the gospel Paul preaches came directly from God, not any human.

**In the second part:** Paul describes how Paul acted before and after God called Paul. After God called Paul, Paul went to Arabia and Damascus.

**In the third part:** Paul tells about Paul's short visit to Jerusalem.

**In the fourth part:** Paul describes how the other believers heard what Paul was doing and praised God.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Jesus Christ, the Son of God
* Church of God, which includes the churches in Judea and the Galatian believers
* Other Jews who were Paul's age
* God
* The Gentiles
* The Apostles in Jerusalem
* Cephas, whose name is also Peter
* And James, the Lord's brother

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In this time, when a person wanted to persuade other people to listen to their idea, this person would often tell a story to support their idea. People trusted information that someone actually saw or heard, so Paul talks about what Paul experienced. Paul's story is also in the book of Acts. Lots of amazing things happened in Paul's story, but Paul specifically chose certain parts to remind the Galatians of. Paul answers some of the questions or doubts that people may have had about Paul and the gospel Paul taught.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about the way you tell your life story and the story of how you believed in Jesus. Usually, you cannot tell every single thing that happened! Imagine you planned to tell your story to a group of people who already knew your story, and you wanted to remind those people of something as you told your story. How would you decide what parts to include? Pause this audio here.

In this passage, Paul responds to what people in Galatia are saying about Paul. People are probably saying that Paul is not an apostle of Jesus Christ and that Paul has not been teaching a true gospel. Here, Paul shows that God chose Paul to be an apostle. Paul constantly points out that people did not choose Paul or give Paul his authority. And Paul emphasizes that the gospel Paul preaches comes from Jesus Christ himself. The Galatians can trust that this is a true and right gospel. People are also trying to convince the Galatians to follow the Jewish religion and laws instead of Christ. Paul says he knows the Jewish way of life, but chose to leave that way of living and follow Christ instead. Paul urges the Galatians to do the same.

In the first part, Paul explains why Paul talks so strongly in the last section. Paul wants to assure the Galatians that they can trust the gospel Paul preaches. Paul does this because Paul cares for the believers, whom Paul calls his family members. Paul often called believers brothers, which Paul used to refer to both the men and the women. Paul clearly explains that the gospel is from God, not from people. People can mess up or change a message, but God does not. People did not come up with this gospel, and no person gave or taught this gospel to Paul. Instead, Paul received it by the revelation of Jesus. This can mean that Jesus revealed the good news to Paul, or that God revealed the good news about Jesus to Paul.

Stop here and discuss how you want to translate the phrase "the revelation of Jesus Christ." In your language, how do you talk about the way that God reveals or makes known something that people previously did not know? Discuss how you have heard this passage before. Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul tells the story of how Paul's life changed when God revealed who Jesus is. Paul first describes what Paul's life was like before. Paul persecuted the church of God. Paul tried to destroy the church, which means Paul wanted to stop anyone from ever believing again.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Imagine someone wants to stop a sports group. This person does not just want to stop the people in the group from playing that sport. This person also wants no one to ever join the group again! How would you describe the way this person tries to stop or destroy the group? Pause this audio here.

Paul was also very devoted to Judaism. Judaism is the religion of the Jewish people, or the way people worshiped God before Jesus came. Paul was advancing in Judaism, which means that Paul was far ahead of other Jews Paul's age in becoming a Jewish religious leader. Paul was zealous or deeply devoted to learning and obeying these teachings and traditions.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how would you describe someone who is deeply devoted to a religious teaching? Pause this audio here.

Paul then describes how God personally called Paul to be an apostle. Though Paul thought he was going to be a Jewish religious leader, God had chosen Paul to be a leader of the believers. God had chosen Paul while Paul was in his mother's womb, or before Paul was even born! Paul did not deserve to be an apostle, but God chose Paul because of God's grace, or kindness to people who do not deserve it. God called or invited Paul to be an apostle when God revealed who Jesus is to Paul.

When God invited Paul, Paul accepted. Because God chose Paul, Paul did not need to consult or ask advice from any "flesh and blood." People used the phrase "flesh and blood" as a way to talk about a person or the body of a person. People would often use this phrase when they wanted to contrast a human with God or something spiritual. Some translations just say human here.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What words or phrases do you use to talk about a person or the body of a person? Discuss how you want to translate "flesh and blood" here. Pause this audio here.

Paul is not an apostle because any man did something, but only because of God. Paul did not need to go to Jerusalem so the apostles could approve Paul. The apostles could not have "chosen" Paul because Paul was far away in Arabia and Damascus, where no apostles lived! And yet for three years, Paul teaches the good news about Jesus in Damascus and Arabia.

In the third part, Paul describes Paul's visit to Jerusalem. Paul says he went "up" to Jerusalem. Paul says "up" because Jerusalem was on a hill. Paul got to know Peter, but Peter did not become Paul's teacher. Paul also met with James, who may have been in the main group of apostles or just another leader in the church. This James was the Lord's brother. Paul often calls Jesus "Lord," so here we know that Paul is talking about Jesus's brother. Paul emphasizes that it was a short visit and that Paul did not even see many apostles. Paul says this to show that God, not the apostles, chose Paul and taught Paul the gospel.

At this point, Paul declares before God that everything Paul writes is true. Paul would often put exclamations like this in Paul's letters. It is like Paul is in front of a judge, where Paul must solemnly promise to tell the truth. Paul knows that God can hear Paul and will agree that what Paul is saying is right.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: If you are trying to convince someone, how do you show that you are really telling the truth? What phrases do you say? When do you say those phrases? What phrases do you have in your language that are similar to what Paul says? Pause this audio here.

In the fourth part, Paul describes what the other believers think of Paul. Paul travels between different regions other than Judea, so the believers in Judea cannot visit Paul easily. Paul says that the other believers in Judea do not know Paul personally. Paul says this to show that Paul is not learning from those believers either. Instead, Paul shares the good news with people who are not believers in Syria and Cilicia. However, people tell the believers in Judea about what Paul is doing. These people tell the believers that Paul is teaching the faith. Sometimes people use the word faith to refer to the good news about Jesus and the way that people believe in Jesus. The believers rejoiced because the believers were happy that God worked through and in Paul. Paul mentions that the believers rejoiced to show that the believers in Judea know that Paul is doing the right thing, even though those believers have not met or chosen Paul. The believers in Judea "glorified God in Paul," which means that the believers praised God because of Paul.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Embodying the Text

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 1:11–24 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has four parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Jesus Christ, the Son of God
* Church of God, which includes the churches in Judea and the Galatian believers
* Other Jews who were Paul's age
* God
* The Gentiles
* The apostles in Jerusalem
* Cephas, whose name is also Peter
* And James, the Lord's brother

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "My dear brothers and sisters, I say this because I want you to understand that the good news I preached to you is not something that a human made up. No person gave me the gospel, nor did a person teach it to me. Instead, I received the gospel by the revelation of Jesus Christ."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Jesus, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I wanted Paul to know who I really am. I do want Paul to tell others about me, but I also care about Paul and want Paul to be in a good relationship with me; or
* I knew that people would challenge Paul and say that Paul does not know the real gospel. That is why God the Father, the Holy Spirit, and I decided to directly speak to Paul. Then Paul would be able to defend himself in these situations; or
* When people are confused about the truth, I am not going to ignore those people. I want my people to know the truth, so I will help them. Sometimes I will speak to those people directly. Sometimes I will send other believers to tell those people the truth.

Ask the person playing the believers in Galatia, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* Even after some of the strong language Paul has used, Paul still calls us brothers and sisters. That makes me feel better. I was worried that Paul was so upset with us that Paul no longer cared for us; or
* I know people can forget or mess up a message. When I hear people say different things about God or Jesus, I worry that people will mess up the message of the gospel by telling it wrong. I am glad to hear that God is directly revealing the message to people like Paul. I am reassured that God will make sure we understand and know the truth.

Continue the drama.

Then Paul says, "You know the story of my life before I became a believer. You know how I obeyed the Jewish customs and how I violently attacked God's people who believe in Jesus. I tried to cause the church to end. I was becoming a leader in the Jewish religion, doing more than most other Jews of my age. I was extremely eager to keep the traditions of my ancestors. But in spite of that, before I was born, God had chosen me to do his work. God was kind to me and invited me to be an apostle. Then God was glad to make me understand who God's Son really is. God did this so that I could tell the news about God's Son to the Gentiles."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I remember how amazed I was when God showed me who Jesus really was. I am still amazed when I think about it now! or
* God has been so kind to me. Even though I face difficult things as an apostle, I am glad and honored that God chose me to do this work; or
* I will tell my story to show the Galatians that I know what I am talking about. I know what it is like to live in the Jewish way of life. I also know how much better it is to live in the way Jesus has asked us to live now!

Ask the person playing God, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I did tell the Jews how to live in a certain way as they waited for the Savior. However, the Jews are still living as if the Savior, Jesus, has not come to save them from their sins! I do not want the Gentiles to go back to that old way of living; or
* All people disobey me and do terrible things. Yet I am more powerful than the way that people sin, and I can change even the worst person; or
* I care about all people, even though those people disobey me and do terrible things. I want people to believe in Jesus and have a good relationship with me. That is why I send people like Paul to tell the good news to all people groups.

> Continue the drama.

Then Paul says, "When this happened, I did not ask anyone to teach me the gospel. I did not go to Jerusalem to learn from those who were apostles before I became an apostle. Instead, I went immediately into the region of Arabia. Then, after some time there, I went back to the city of Damascus. Three years after God revealed Jesus to me, I went up to Jerusalem to get to know Peter. I stayed only fifteen days with him. I also met James, the brother of the Lord Jesus. But I did not see any of the other apostles. God knows that what I am writing to you is not a lie."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Peter and James, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I was surprised when I met Paul, because Paul used to persecute the believers. However, I then rejoiced because I could see how God had changed Paul; or
* I am glad that God is revealing the good news to people I have not even met yet. God is working and changing people, even if we believers have not been able to talk to those people yet; or
* Of course, we talked about Jesus with Paul, but it was clear that Paul already knew the good news about Jesus. God was Paul's teacher, and God is a much better teacher than we are.

Continue the drama.

Paul says, "When I left Jerusalem, I traveled to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. During that time, the groups of believers in the region of Judea did not know me personally. However, someone had told the believers in Jerusalem that, 'This man, Paul, formerly attacked us believers. Now Paul is telling people to have faith in Christ. Before, Paul tried to destroy people who had faith in Christ!' Because of this report about me, the believers were praising God."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing the believers in Judea, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I used to be afraid of Paul. I worried that Paul would attack the gatherings of believers in our towns. But now Paul not only believes in Jesus, but is telling other people the good news about Jesus! I am amazed at what our God can do to change people; or
* People are reporting to us about the gospel that Paul is teaching. I am glad that Paul is doing the same work we are doing. We all want people to know the truth about Jesus; or
* I know that God must have changed Paul. When I hear stories like this, I want to sing and talk to God and tell everyone how wonderful and kind our God is!

Ask the person playing the believers in Galatia, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* Whenever I hear Paul's story, I am amazed at what God did to change Paul; or
* I can see now that the believers in Judea agree with what Paul is doing. That is why they rejoice and praise God; or
* I forgot that Paul knows a lot about the Jewish way of life and the way that Jesus asks us to live. I guess Paul does know what Paul is talking about.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 1:11–24 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul calls the believers in Galatia "**brothers**." Since God is the Father of all believers, all believers are like brothers and sisters. So Paul frequently uses the word for brother when Paul refers to a fellow believer. When Paul speaks to more than one believer, Paul may use the word "brothers" to mean both brothers and sisters. For more information on brothers, refer to believer in the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for brothers as you used in previous passages.

Humans did not make up the **gospel** Paul preaches. Gospel means "good news." The good news in the Bible is that God has made a way to save people. For more information on gospel, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for gospel as you used in previous passages.

Paul preaches the true gospel. In the original language, this word literally means to evangelize or teach the good news about Jesus. Use the same word or phrase for preach as you used in previous passages.

Paul received a revelation of Jesus Christ. Revelation is when God reveals or makes known something that people did not know or did not see before. This can include God's nature, God's will, or specific truths that God wants people to understand. This revelation was the good news about who Jesus is and how Jesus saves people.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **revelation**. Look up revelation in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

**Christ** is a title for Jesus that reminds the believers that Jesus is the Messiah, or the Savior and king that God chose to come and rescue people. For more information on Christ, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Christ as you used in previous passages.

Paul used to be devoted to Judaism. Judaism is the Jewish religion, including customs and traditions. God asked the Jews to live in a certain way as they waited for the Savior. The Jewish people added lots of traditions and customs to help them remember the laws and ways of life that God told them about.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **Judaism**. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul used to persecute the church of God. When people persecute you, those people treat you cruelly and unfairly. People can beat you, or exclude you from society, or speak lies about you and take you to court.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **persecute**. Look up persecution in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

The **church** is a community of people who believe in Jesus. People would often use the phrase "church of God" to mean all the people on earth together who believe in Jesus. Paul also talks about the churches of Judea, which means groups of believers in the region of Judea. For more information on church, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for church as you used in previous passages.

Paul was zealous for the traditions of Paul's ancestors. When someone is zealous, that person is so passionately devoted to someone or something that they are jealous for that relationship to stay pure.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **zealous**. Look up zeal in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

God called Paul because of God's **grace**. God gives believers grace when God is kind to believers, even though the believers do not deserve it. For more information on grace, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for grace as you used in previous passages.

God showed Paul who the Son of God really is. The Son of God is a title for Jesus. Jesus is called the Son of God because Jesus has a special relationship with God the Father. God and Jesus love each other in the way that a father and a son love each other. This title also shows that Jesus is God, too.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **Son**. Look up "Son of God" in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

God chose Paul to preach about Jesus to the Gentiles. The word Gentile refers to all people who were not Jews.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **Gentile**. Look up Gentile in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Right after God chose Paul, Paul did not go see the **apostles** in Jerusalem. An apostle is someone who received special authority from Jesus to speak on Jesus' behalf. For more information on apostle, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for apostle as you used in previous passages.

Paul sees James, the **Lord's** brother. A lord is a master over other people, who has full authority, so the Israelites used this word for God, because God has authority over the whole world. Paul often called Jesus Lord to remind people that Jesus is God, too. For more information on Lord, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Lord as you used in previous passages.

People report that Paul teaches the faith. Faith means to rely on someone, to trust and believe that what that person says is true. This specific faith is the way people believe in Jesus. That person believes that Jesus is the Son of God and trusts that Jesus has died for that person's sins and that God has forgiven and accepted that person.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **faith**. Look up faith in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

The believers glorified or praised God because of what Paul was doing. These two words mean something similar. When you praise or glorify God, you speak out loud good things about God and to God, because you recognize that God is good and awesome and that God deserves great honor. You thank God for the good things God has done and the blessings God will give.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **praise** or **glorify**. Look up praise and glorify in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there.

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 2:1–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

Paul has been telling his life story to remind the Galatians that God chose Paul to be an apostle. In this passage, Paul continues Paul's story. Paul tells about the second time Paul went to Jerusalem, this time to meet with the apostles. During this trip, the apostles agreed that God had given Paul authority as an apostle. The apostles also agreed that Paul teaches the true gospel.

At the beginning of this passage, Paul says he returned to Jerusalem after 14 years. This is probably 14 years from Paul's last visit. This time, Paul traveled with Barnabas, another believer who worked and traveled with Paul. Paul also traveled with Titus, who became a believer because of Paul's teaching. God had revealed to Paul that Paul should go to Jerusalem. This is a different revelation than when God revealed to Paul who Jesus is. When Paul arrived in Jerusalem, Paul met privately with the respected leaders of the believers. The leaders are James, Jesus' brother; Cephas, whose name is also Peter; and John. Both Peter and John were two of Jesus's 12 closest disciples. Paul told these leaders the gospel that Paul had been teaching to the Gentiles.

Paul did this because Paul wanted his work to be effective. Paul compares the way Paul tells people about Jesus to a person who runs a race. In this time, people would gather together to watch men compete to see who could run the fastest or longest. The winner would get a prize, so runners would prepare and work hard for that prize. Paul also prepares and works hard for Paul's goal. Neither person wants to work without any result. Paul does not doubt that the gospel is true or that Paul is doing the right thing. Paul is confident that Jesus gave Paul the true gospel to share. But Paul is worried that the believers might divide into groups of Gentile believers and Jewish believers.

Some of the believers from the Jewish people group still follow the laws and customs of the Jewish religion. James, Peter, and John are also from the Jewish people group. Paul wanted to know if the leaders would accept the Gentile believers, even though the Gentiles are from a different people group and do not follow the Jewish laws. Paul wants everyone to know that Paul and the church leaders agreed while Paul was in Jerusalem that the gospel does not require people to act like a Jewish person and follow the Jewish laws.

Because the church leaders agreed, the leaders did not require Titus to follow the Jewish rule about circumcision. To circumcise someone means to cut off the loose skin at the end of a boy's or man's penis. Jews circumcised their sons to obey the law. Only Jewish people would do this. Since Titus was not a Jew, no one had ever circumcised Titus. Because the leaders agreed that believers do not have to follow the Jewish rules anymore, Titus stayed uncircumcised.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What are some things that people in your people group do or do not do to their bodies to show that they are members of your group? Why do people do this? If someone wanted to join your people group, perhaps by marrying someone in your group, what would that person have to do to officially become a part of your group? Pause this audio here.

Some people had complained about the way that the believers did not circumcise new Gentile believers who were men. Paul calls these people false brothers or believers. These people believed that Jesus was the savior, but they insisted that the Gentiles must also follow the Jewish religious law. The Jewish religious law required circumcision for people to be right before God. But when people believe in Christ Jesus, these believers do not have to receive circumcision like the Jews who obeyed the law did. The false believers did not understand that they had right standing with God because of what Christ did, not because of how they followed the Jewish law.

Other believers did not realize that this group of false believers was teaching things that were not the gospel. Christ Jesus freed believers from following the law, but the false believers wanted believers to follow the law again. But if the believers followed the Jewish law, they would be just like slaves, and they would no longer be free! But Paul did not agree to the false believers' demands. For the sake of the Galatian believers, Paul is determined to make sure no one changes the true good news.

One way Paul did this was to meet with the leaders. These leaders were important to the believers. Paul compares James, Peter, and John to pillars. A pillar is a huge stone post or wood column that supports the roof of a building. Pillars are an important part of a building, just like these men had important jobs in the church. Paul knew that it was important to talk with those leaders because the other believers listened to what those leaders said. However, many people thought that the leaders in Jerusalem were more important than other believers, perhaps because these leaders had spent time with Jesus. But Paul knew that God does not choose certain people to be God's favorites or to be more important than others, so Paul did not do that either. Paul spoke to these leaders to assure people that the believers in different areas agreed.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think of some important members of your community. What would you compare those leaders to in order to show how important they are? Pause this audio here.

These leaders agreed that Paul was teaching the true message already. The leaders recognized that God made Paul an apostle because of God's grace or kindness. God gave Paul the gifts and power to be an apostle and tell others the gospel. God trusted both Paul and Peter to teach the one true gospel. Just as Peter taught the gospel to the Jews, Paul would teach the Gentiles. These leaders shook hands with Paul and Barnabas to show that the leaders accepted and supported Paul and Barnabas.

Paul and the leaders are partners in the work to tell others the gospel, but they will work among different groups of people.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what do people do to show that they are working together and agree on something? Pause this audio here.

Paul would go to Gentile lands, and Peter would go to the Jewish homeland. These were just general directions for Paul and Peter. Jews were also in the Gentile lands, and many Gentiles lived in the Jewish homeland. Paul and Peter will still teach both groups of people.

Stop here and look at a map of Judea, the Jewish homeland, and nearby countries as a group. To the Jews, any land that was not the Jewish homeland was Gentile land. Pause this audio here.

The leaders did ask that Paul and Barnabas continue to help the needy believers in Jerusalem. At that time, believers in Jerusalem were poor and had a difficult time getting enough food. Paul agreed. Paul already wanted to help the poor as Paul had in the past. The leaders and Paul really were agreeing on everything!

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 2:1–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has four parts.

**In the first part:** Paul explains why Paul traveled to Jerusalem and with whom.

**In the second part:** Paul tells how Paul met privately with the leaders in Jerusalem to explain the message that Paul preaches to the Gentiles. The leaders agreed that Paul taught the true message, and the leaders did not require someone to circumcise Titus.

**In the third part:** Paul explains how false believers caused trouble and why Paul and Barnabas do not agree to circumcise Titus.

**In the fourth part:** Paul describes what the leaders and Paul agreed upon during their meeting.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Barnabas
* Titus
* The leaders in Jerusalem, who are James, John, and Cephas, whose name is also Peter
* The Gentiles
* The false believers
* Christ Jesus
* The Galatian believers
* God
* The Jewish people
* And the poor believers in Jerusalem

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

This passage is all about Paul's second trip to Jerusalem. Though Paul begins by describing how and why Paul traveled, Paul does not tell the story in the exact order that it happened. Paul quickly states the result of the meeting with the church leaders. Then Paul explains why Paul mentions circumcision. After that, Paul explains exactly what Paul and the leaders agreed on during the meeting. Paul is not focusing on the order in which these things happened. Paul focuses on how the things that church leaders told Paul in Jerusalem show that Paul is right to teach Paul's message.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: As an activity, tell the story of a trip you took. As you tell the story, explain why you took the trip and acted in certain ways on the trip. Pay attention to the order in which you describe your actions, why you did those things, and what happened because you did those things. Pause this audio here.

In the first part, Paul describes when Paul went to Jerusalem, who Paul traveled with, and why Paul traveled. For the 14 years since Paul's last visit to Jerusalem, Paul had been teaching the gospel. Paul emphasizes how long Paul has been away from Jerusalem to show that Paul did not need people to approve of Paul and Paul's gospel. God had already approved Paul. After 14 years, though, God revealed to Paul that God wanted Paul to visit Jerusalem. This second visit is not any person's choice, but God's. Paul is showing that Paul is following God's authority, not the authority of the apostles. Again, Paul says Paul went "up" to Jerusalem. Paul says "up" because Jerusalem is on the top of a hill.

In the second part, Paul talks about the private meeting Paul had with the leaders. Later in the passage, Paul explains that these leaders were James, John, and Peter, whose name is also Cephas. Paul says that people esteemed or respected these men. Barnabas was with Paul during this meeting, but Titus was probably not. During this meeting, Paul explained the message that Paul teaches to the Gentiles. Paul gave this report so that Paul could be sure that the work that Paul does and the work that Paul has done was not like a race that Paul has run for no reason.

Though Paul does not say it directly, Paul shows that the leaders agreed with Paul by the things Paul says about Titus. One thing that Paul teaches is that because of the gospel, people do not need to follow the Jewish law anymore. If the church leaders had not agreed with Paul, the leaders would have required that someone circumcise Titus. Paul explains that no one had circumcised Titus in the past because Titus is Greek. Greek people are from the country of Greece, but sometimes, people used the word "Greek" to refer to Gentile people. So here, Paul may have just been saying that Titus was a Gentile. Gentile people do not circumcise their men.

Stop here and discuss how you want to talk about circumcision in an appropriate way. Pause this audio here.

In the third part, Paul explains why Paul uses Titus's circumcision as proof that Paul teaches the true gospel. One reason is that some people said that believers should circumcise the men. Paul calls these people "false brothers." Paul means that though these false believers are a part of the group of believers, these people really should not be part of that group! Paul says these people slipped or snuck in like a spy sneaks into an enemy camp. These false brothers want to replace the freedom believers have in Christ Jesus with the rules of the law.

The second reason that Paul uses Titus's circumcision as an example is that some false believers talked about circumcision to the Galatians, too. Paul shows how Paul and Barnabas did not agree with the false believers in Jerusalem to show that Paul also does not agree with the false believers in Galatia. Paul wants the believers in Galatia to understand what the true gospel is!

So Paul tells the story of how, in Jerusalem, Paul and Barnabas did not give in or agree to circumcise Titus. Paul emphasizes that Paul and Barnabas never agreed when he says, "We did not agree even for a short amount of time!" In the same way, the Galatians should not agree either.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What phrases do you have in your language to emphasize how something never happened? Pause this audio here.

In the fourth part, Paul describes the three things that the leaders did during the meeting. First, the leaders agreed that God had given Paul the true gospel, so they did not tell Paul to change anything. At this point, Paul pauses and explains why Paul keeps saying that the people respect these leaders. Paul is not saying that these men are more important because of something these men have done. Whoever these men were before God chose them is not important. God does not choose people because of things like how wealthy or important those people are. God chooses people because of God's grace, which is kindness to people who do not deserve that kindness.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Paul pauses his story to explain what Paul means about the respected leaders. When you tell a story in your language, when might you pause your story to explain why you tell the story a certain way? Discuss how you want to translate Paul's explanation in Paul's story. Pause this audio here.

The second thing the leaders did was recognize the way that God was kind to Paul and chose Paul to be an apostle. Paul is an apostle just like Peter is an apostle. Paul compares himself to Peter, since people knew that God was working through Peter. Some translations say God worked in Peter and Paul to be apostles. Both of these things are true. God gave Peter the job of primarily teaching the Jews, while God gave Paul the job of teaching the Gentiles. Because the Jews circumcised their boys and men, people sometimes called the Jews the circumcised people and the Gentiles the uncircumcised people. So some translations say "Jews" and some say "circumcised people," but both mean the same thing.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think of some different groups of people in your area, like people on a sports team, or people who all do the same kind of work. When are some times when you would refer to the group, or people in the group, by the things those people do? Pause this audio here.

Because the leaders see the way God chose Paul to be an apostle, the leaders give Paul and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship. This means the leaders shake Paul and Barnabas' right hands with their right hands. In this time, this was a common way that people showed they agreed with each other and would work together. The leaders were showing that they were already in agreement because God had given both of them the gospel.

The last thing the leaders do is ask Paul and Barnabas to remember the poor believers. This means that Paul and Barnabas should remember to continue to help the poor believers in Jerusalem. Paul has been eager to do this all along, which means Paul already wanted to continue to help the poor believers as Paul had in the past.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 2:1–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has four parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Barnabas
* Titus
* The leaders in Jerusalem, who are James, John, and Cephas, whose name is also Peter
* The Gentiles
* The false believers
* Christ Jesus
* The Galatian believers
* God
* The Jewish people
* And the poor believers in Jerusalem

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "Then fourteen years later, I went up to Jerusalem again. This time, Barnabas and Titus went with me. I went because God revealed to me that I should go. When we arrived there, I met privately with the leaders of the believers. I explained to the leaders the message that I preach to the Gentiles. I gave this report so that I could be sure that the work that I am doing and the work that I have done was not like a race that I had run for nothing. And the leaders agreed with me. This was clear because no one demanded that someone circumcise my companion Titus. Titus was a Gentile, and no one had ever circumcised Titus."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* God wants the believers to work, worship, and be together as one group. I can see the way that this helps us believers. I do not want the believers to split into different groups; or
* I know that God has told me the truth about the good news. I hope the leaders in Jerusalem remember what Jesus taught them, which is the same good news; or
* I will bring Titus with me, so that the believers in Jerusalem can see that Titus is a believer like them, even though Titus is a Gentile.

Ask the person playing Titus, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I was a little nervous about going to Jerusalem. I know that some Jewish people do not like to interact with Gentile people. I hope the believers in Jerusalem will understand that believers are all God's people now, no matter what people group they belong to; or
* I have seen the way that God has led Paul to teach. I hope the believers in Jerusalem understand that, too. I will gladly tell the believers in Jerusalem how I have seen God help Paul; or
* I am so glad that the leaders agreed that no one needs to circumcise me. That would be very painful!

Continue the drama.

Then Paul says, "We talked about this problem because of some men who pretended to be believers. These men snuck into our group of believers. These men came to spy on us and take away the freedom that we have because we believe in Christ Jesus. These men did this in order to make us slaves to the law of Moses. We never accepted what these men said. We were determined to keep the true good news pure for your sake."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing the false believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* If God told us to follow the law in the past, we still have to follow the law now! I do not care if anyone says something different; or
* Circumcision and all these laws show that we are different than the people around us. People will not know that they are not in our group if we do not continue to follow the laws; or
* I want anyone who joins the group of believers to act like me and other Jewish people. I do not feel comfortable around people who are not just like me.

Ask the person playing Jesus, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* The Jewish people were supposed to obey the law to be in right standing with God the Father until I came. Now I cause people to be in right standing with God; or
* The law was supposed to cause people to look forward to their Savior. I am their Savior, and I have come. Now, these people do not need the law to remind them of me; or
* I love people from all people groups. Believers do not have to act like Jewish people to be my people. People just have to believe in me!

Continue the drama.

Paul says, "But the leaders of the church did not tell me to teach something different. It is not important to me what the leaders' status was before, because God does not have any favorites. Instead, those leaders realized that God had given me the responsibility of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles. God gave me that work just as God had given Peter the work of telling that same good news to the Jews. God helped Peter to do his work well as an apostle among the Jews. In the same way, God also helped me to do my work well as an apostle among the Gentiles."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am so thankful that God is helping me and Peter to do this work. We face so many difficult and dangerous situations. Peter and I could not do this on our own! or
* I know that these leaders are wise and that people listen to them. That is why I want to go talk to these leaders. But I know that we should treat every believer just as kindly and honorably as we treat these leaders; or
* I was so glad that we all agreed during this meeting. It is good to know that other believers support me and listen to what God says.

Ask the person playing God, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I care about all people, and I will send believers to go tell the good news to all different groups of people; or
* I chose Peter, Paul, and the other leaders for certain work. This does not mean l like these believers more than other believers. I give all believers good and important jobs to do; or
* I do not choose certain people because of who they are or what they have done. All people are sinners before they believe in Jesus. And once people believe in Jesus, I love all of those people equally as my children!

Continue the drama.

Then Paul says, "James, Peter, and John were important men in the church, and those men realized that God was kind to me and chose me to spread the good news. So those men shook hands with Barnabas and me as a sign that they agreed with us. We agreed that Barnabas and I would work where the Gentiles mainly lived, and James, Peter, and John would work where the Jews mainly lived. The only thing that the leaders asked us to do was to continue to remember to help the needy believers in Jerusalem. This was the same thing that I had always tried to do."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing James, John, and Peter, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am happy that God is choosing other people like Paul and Barnabas to teach other people about Jesus! If more people share the good news, then people will hear the gospel quicker and believe in Jesus! or
* Since all the believers are part of God's family, we should care for each other like we would care for our family members. If our brothers and sisters in another city were in trouble, we would want to help them, too! or
* It was good to hear how Paul is teaching the gospel to other people. I know God helps all of us teach the truth. If God were not helping us, we might make mistakes!

Ask the person playing Barnabas, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am encouraged that the leaders in Jerusalem agree that we are working together. We can pray for each other and support each other when we have to do hard things; or
* It is amazing how God reminds and teaches us the same things. The leaders in Jerusalem were asking for help, and God had already caused us to want to help those leaders! or
* I am so thankful for the way that God causes us believers to have peace and good relationships even though we come from different groups and places.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 2:1–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul goes to Jerusalem because of a **revelation**. Revelation is when God reveals or makes known something that was previously hidden or unknown. This can include God's nature, God's will, or specific truths that God wants people to understand. This revelation is instructions for Paul to go to Jerusalem to meet with the leaders there. For more information on revelation, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for revelation as you used in previous passages.

Paul explains the **gospel** that Paul preaches to the Gentiles. Gospel means "good news." The good news in the Bible is that God has made a way to save people. For more information on gospel, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for gospel as you used in previous passages.

The word Gentile refers to all people who are not Jews. Paul says that Titus is a Greek. In this time, people would sometimes use the word for people who belong to the country called Greece to mean a Gentile. So whether Titus is from the country of Greece or just from another people group that is not the Jews, Titus is a Gentile. For more information on Gentile, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Gentile as you used in previous passages.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for the way Paul calls Titus **Greek**. Look up Greek in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul met with the leaders of the church. These leaders are James, John, and Cephas, whose name is also Peter.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **the leaders of the church**. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

The leaders did not demand that someone circumcise Titus. Circumcision is the Jewish custom where people cut off the loose skin at the end of a boy's penis. The circumcision was a sign that the person was included in the covenant that God had made with Abraham. If someone who was not a descendant of Abraham wanted to become part of the Jews and a part of the covenant the Jews had with God, someone had to circumcise that person as well. Only men had to be circumcised in order to be acceptable to God. Since Jews were the only people who circumcised their men, people sometimes referred to the Jews as "the circumcised people" and Gentiles as the "uncircumcised people."

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **circumcised**. Look up circumcision in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul says that there were false **brothers** in the group. Paul frequently uses the word for brother when Paul refers to a fellow believer. When there is more than one believer, the word can also mean brothers and sisters. Here, Paul may be using the word brother to show how these false believers were not caring for each other like family members should. For more information on brothers or believers, refer to believer in the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for brothers as you used in previous passages.

Believers have freedom in **Christ** Jesus. Christ is a title for Jesus that reminds the believers that Jesus is the Messiah, or the Savior and king that God chose to come and rescue people. For more information on Christ, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Christ as you used in previous passages.

These false believers wanted to cause the believers to be like slaves. A slave is a person who does work for someone else. A slave does not receive payment for his work and does not have the freedom to leave his master when he wants. A slave is different from a servant, which is what Paul called himself earlier in this book.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **slave**. Look up slave in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

God gave Peter the responsibility to preach the gospel to the Jews. "Jews" refers to the people who are descendants of Jacob. When people use the word Jews, people often think especially about the people who are devoted to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and who want to keep the covenant that God has made with Jacob's descendants. Use the same word or phrase for preach as you used in previous passages.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **Jew**. Look up Jew in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

God chose both Peter and Paul to be **apostles**. An apostle is someone who received special authority from Jesus to speak on Jesus' behalf. Apostles tell people that Jesus really rose from the dead, preach the gospel to all people, and have authority in the church. For more information on apostle, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for apostle as you used in previous passages.

The leaders in Jerusalem gave Paul and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship. This means the leaders shook Paul and Barnabas's hands to show that they had fellowship. When people have fellowship with each other, they are friendly with each other. These people find the same thing important and frequently come together to talk about that, or to do something together. When the leaders did this, they showed that they were partners with and agreed with Paul and Barnabas.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for the way that the leaders show that they have **fellowship** with Paul and Barnabas. Look up fellowship in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

The leaders agreed that God had given grace to Paul. Grace is the way God shows kindness to people who do not deserve that kindness. Here, grace means something good that God has done for a particular person or something good that God has given to that person. God gave Paul grace to become an apostle. Paul did not deserve to become an apostle, but God still made Paul an apostle. God showed Paul grace. In the original language, this is the same word for grace that Paul used earlier.

If needed, stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **grace** in this situation. Look up grace in the Master Glossary for more information.

Setting the Stage

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 2:11–14 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In the last section, Paul told the story of how the leaders in Jerusalem agreed with Paul about the message of the gospel. Now Paul tells the story of when Cephas, or Peter, visited Antioch. During Peter's visit, Peter ate and interacted with the Gentile believers. But then Peter became worried about what Jews would think about what Peter was doing. So Peter decided to separate himself from the Gentile believers. The way Peter acted was different than the way the gospel says to act. So Paul told Peter that Peter acted in a very wrong way.

The Jewish law says that Jews cannot eat with Gentiles. This was to keep the Jews from eating food that God said Jews could not eat. These foods made the Jews unclean or unfit to worship God. The Jews wanted to worship God and did not want to do anything that would make them unclean! Gentiles would not have chosen and prepared the food to follow the strict rules that the Jews followed. Sometimes, to keep these rules, the Jews would do many things separately from the Gentiles. If a Gentile person wanted to eat and interact with the Jews, the Gentiles would have to follow all the Jewish rules too!

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What are some people groups or religions near you that have rules about what their people can or cannot eat? Why do these people do this? What happens when people from these different groups interact? Pause this audio here.

But now, believers no longer need to follow these rules about food, even if those believers are from the Jewish people group. The believers in Antioch understood this. Antioch was an important city in the region of Syria. Both Gentile and Jewish believers lived in this city, and they apparently lived peacefully with each other. The Jewish and Gentile believers ate meals together as equals. This probably means the Jewish and Gentile believers also took the Lord's supper together. The believers would eat bread and drink wine to remember how Jesus died for people. When the believers from different groups, like the Jews and Gentiles, ate together, they showed that they were at peace with each other and accepted each other.

Stop here and look at a map of Antioch and Jerusalem as a group. Pause this audio here.

Paul tells the story of how Peter came to visit while Paul and Barnabas were teaching in Antioch. When Peter arrived, Peter joined the other believers and ate with the Gentile believers. God had already shown Peter that believers can now eat all foods. Food will not cause a believer to be unclean. But Peter did not just show that food does not make believers unclean. Because Peter ate with the Gentiles, Peter was also declaring that the Gentile believers did not need to follow the Jewish law to interact with the Jewish believers. Peter showed that Peter accepted and wanted to have fellowship with the Gentile believers.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, when you share a meal with someone, what does this show other people about your relationship with that person? How would you show that you accepted another person, even though that person is different than you? Pause this audio here.

However, Peter changed his actions when a group of men from James arrived in Antioch. James was probably in Jerusalem at this time. It is not clear if James sent these men, or if these men were just James' friends. While this group of men was in Antioch, Peter started to act differently. Peter started to eat meals separately from the Gentile believers. Peter even stopped interacting with the Gentile believers!

Paul says that Peter was afraid of the "circumcision group." This "circumcision group" of believers still followed the Jewish customs. The group insisted that someone must circumcise men for God to accept those men. This group probably included the men from James as well as some of the believers in Antioch. Peter may have been afraid of what this group would think or say about Peter because Peter was eating with the Gentile believers.

Peter stopped eating with the Gentiles in order to obey Jewish customs. Because of this, people thought Peter was showing that believers had to follow Jewish customs too. Other Jewish believers followed Peter's example and began to avoid the Gentile believers. Even Barnabas did this! Peter and the other Jewish believers in Antioch knew that it was not wrong to eat with the Gentile believers. But because the Jews from Jerusalem were there, Peter and the Jewish believers acted as if they believed that it was not good to eat with Gentile believers. Peter and the Jewish believers did that because they were more worried about what people thought was right than what God thought was right.

Paul saw that Peter and the other Jewish believers did not obey the true words of the gospel. God promised in the gospel that all believers are equal, no matter what people group they come from. But now, people acted like Jewish believers were better or more important than Gentile believers.

Paul knew that Paul needed to correct Peter. In Jewish culture, a person would often rebuke or correct another person privately. But Peter's actions are so serious that Paul decided to correct Peter in front of other believers. Paul was concerned both about what Peter believed and the way that other believers followed Peter's example. Since Peter was an apostle, believers would pay attention to what Peter did. Because Peter acted publicly in a way that was different than the truth of the gospel, Paul needed to correct Peter in public. Then everyone would know not to act like Peter acts right now. If Paul did not say anything, people might think Paul agreed with Peter.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Imagine someone you know acted in a very wrong way. In your culture, how would you correct or rebuke this person? When are some times that you would correct someone in front of other people? Why would you do this? Pause this audio here.

So in front of the other believers, Paul rebuked Peter. Paul said that Peter is a Jew, but that Peter acts like a Gentile. Because Peter ate with the Gentiles when Peter arrived in Antioch, Peter stopped following Jewish rules. So Peter then lived like a Gentile or did what the Gentiles did. If Peter does not live like a Jew or follow the Jewish laws, then Peter cannot force the Gentiles to follow the Jewish customs. When Peter acts this way, it is as if Peter says that believers need to obey these laws and live like Jews. Peter acts like a hypocrite or someone who says to do one thing and then acts in a different way!

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 2:11–14 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul begins the story of how Paul corrected Peter in Antioch. When Peter arrived, Peter ate and interacted with the Gentile believers.

**In the second part:** When men from James arrived in Antioch, Peter gradually stopped eating with the Gentile believers. Peter, Barnabas, and other Jewish believers began to separate themselves from the Gentile believers.

**In the third part:** In front of the other believers, Paul rebuked Peter.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Cephas, whose name is also Peter
* Gentile believers
* The group of men from James
* Jewish believers
* And Barnabas

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In the first part, Paul explains what this part of the story will be about. It is like Paul says, "This is the story of the time when I had to correct Cephas in Antioch." Cephas is another name for Peter. Paul had to oppose or confront Peter because Peter had acted in a very wrong way. Paul confronted Peter to Peter's face, or in Peter's presence. Paul did not criticize Peter when Peter could not hear Paul.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how would you show that you confronted or criticized someone where that person could hear you? Pause this audio here.

Paul says Peter stood condemned, which is a strong way to say that Peter was guilty of disobeying God. Since Paul is telling stories to explain certain things to the Galatians, we can know that what Paul says to Peter will apply to the Galatians' issue, too. Now that Paul has said what this part of the story will be about, Paul then explains what happened.

Stop here and discuss as a group: As an activity, tell a short story from your life, but first announce what the story will be about. Discuss as a group some times when you would begin a story like that. Pause this audio here.

Remember that in the last passage, Paul and Barnabas were in Jerusalem. Now, in this story, Paul and Barnabas were working in the city of Antioch, and Peter came to visit. It is not clear exactly why Peter came to Antioch. Because Antioch is over 500 kilometers from Jerusalem, Peter probably stayed for at least several weeks. When Peter first arrived in Antioch, Peter regularly joined both Jews and Gentiles to eat.

In the second part, some men traveled from James, who was probably in Jerusalem, to Antioch. When those men arrived, Peter began to gradually separate himself from being a part of the Gentile group of believers. Peter even stopped eating with those believers. Paul says Peter did this because Peter was afraid of the people who said that someone should circumcise Gentile believers. Peter may have worried that Jews, both believers and non\-believers, would think badly of Peter and not listen to Peter. But no matter why Peter did it, Peter acted in a way that did not agree with the gospel Peter taught. Peter acted in a hypocritical way.

Other Jewish believers joined Peter and also acted in a hypocritical way. Though the believers knew and taught that everyone was equal, the Jewish believers now acted like the Gentile believers were bad or dangerous to be around. Remember that in the last passage, Peter and the leaders in Jerusalem agreed that people did not need to be Jewish to be believers. However, in this passage, Peter acted like the Gentile believers were not real believers. Paul says even Barnabas followed Peter's example. It is like the truth of the gospel is the right road, but Barnabas allowed the Jewish believers to lead Barnabas along the wrong road.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How would you describe the way that a person believes or says to act in one way, but then that person actually acts in a different way? Pause this audio here.

In the third part, Paul confronted Peter. Paul did not do this immediately after Peter began acting differently, but only after this became a big problem in the church. Paul says that Peter and the other Jewish believers did not act in step with the truth of the gospel. This means the Jewish believers did not really obey the gospel, which is true. So Paul decided to correct Peter. Paul continues to show that the leaders in Jerusalem do not have authority over Paul. Paul and Peter are like co\-workers and can correct each other.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Twice, Paul compares the way a person obeys the gospel to the way people walk on a good and right road. Paul says that the Jewish believers lead Barnabas off the right path. Paul also says the Jewish believers do not act in step or follow the steps of the gospel. In your language, how would you talk about the way that people obey or follow certain rules for living? What would you compare this obedience to? Discuss how you want to translate the way the Jewish believers lead Barnabas astray because they are not in step. The Jewish believers do not follow the right road, which is the right way to live in the gospel. Pause this audio here.

Paul spoke to Peter in front of the other believers, so the other believers could also hear how their behavior was wrong. Paul declared that though Peter is from the Jewish people group, Peter does not follow the Jewish laws and customs anymore. Peter acts like a Gentile. Paul then asked a question that Paul did not expect anyone to answer. With this question, Paul strongly showed that Peter acted in a wrong way. Because of the way Peter acted, it is as if Peter was saying that believers needed to live like Jews. Paul says it does not make sense for Peter to say this because Peter himself does not follow all the Jewish laws!

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Embodying the Text

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 2:11–14 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Cephas, whose name is also Peter
* Gentile believers
* The group of men from James
* Jewish believers
* And Barnabas

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "One day, Peter came to visit the believers in Antioch, where I was. While Peter was in Antioch, I corrected Peter in front of the other believers, because Peter had done something that was very wrong. Here is what happened. Peter was eating with the Gentiles, but then some men from James arrived. After these men arrived in Antioch, Peter began to avoid eating with or even interacting with the Gentile believers. Peter did this because Peter was afraid of those people who insisted that circumcision was necessary."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Peter, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* When I first arrived in Antioch, I was glad to meet with all the believers and hear what God has done in their lives! or
* Now I am worried about what my people will think about me. If I do not follow the Jewish customs, my people may not respect me. Then my people may not listen to me when I talk about the gospel; or
* Paul can teach the Gentiles, so Paul can act like a Gentile. Since I teach the Jews, I will behave as the Jews do. It is not like I am leaving the Gentiles without someone to tell them the truth. And the Gentiles can eat and encourage each other, while I eat with and encourage the Jews.

Ask the person playing the Gentile believers in Antioch, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* When Peter first arrived, it was good to get to know Peter and spend time with him. I love meeting other people who love God like I do; or
* I was surprised and confused when Peter stopped eating meals with us. It was like Peter did not like us anymore; or
* Peter is avoiding us like the Jews do. It is as if Peter does not believe that the Gentiles are also a part of God's family. I am upset that Peter is treating us like this.

Continue the drama.

Paul says, "Then the other Jewish believers there joined with Peter. Those believers also began to act in a way that they knew was not right. Even Barnabas joined those believers to act in that wrong way."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Jewish believers and Barnabas, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* It is a lot nicer and easier to eat with and interact with people from my people group. Those people think and act like me. I am glad that I can act like Peter and only interact with the Jews; or
* We respect Peter. God has taught Peter many things. If Peter acts like this, I should probably act like Peter does too; or
* Maybe it would be better if I follow the Jewish customs and laws. If God told us to follow these laws before, maybe we should still follow them now.

Continue the drama.

Paul says, "But when I discovered that Peter and the Jewish believers were not obeying the true gospel, I said to Peter in front of everyone, 'You are a Jew, but you act like a Gentile. You do not act like a Jew. It is wrong for you to force Gentile believers to act like Jews.'"

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am angry that Peter is treating the Gentile believers like this! Peter is acting like the Gentiles are less important. Peter is acting like the Gentiles are bad people to be around! or
* I am surprised and disappointed that people follow Peter's example when they know that God does not say to do this in his gospel. Even Barnabas is acting in the wrong way! or
* I want the believers to live peacefully with each other and work together. The believers cannot do this if some groups think they are better than the other groups and stay away from the others. They are treating each other in an unkind way.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 2:11–14 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul says that Peter was condemned, which means that Peter was guilty of acting in a wrong way.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **condemned**. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

When Peter first arrived in Antioch, Peter ate with the **Gentiles**. The word Gentile refers to all people who were not Jews. Here, Paul probably means the Gentile believers. For more information on Gentile, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Gentile as you used in previous passages.

Peter was afraid of the people in the **circumcision** group. Circumcision, or to circumcise someone, is the Jewish custom where people cut off the loose skin at the end of a boy's penis. The circumcision was a sign that God included that person in the covenant that God had made with Abraham. The people in the circumcision group believed that circumcision was necessary to be a believer. For more information on circumcision, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for circumcision as you used in previous passages.

The **Jews** began to act like Peter acted. "Jews" refers to the people who descended from Jacob. Here, Paul probably means the Jewish believers. For more information on Jew, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Jew as you used in previous passages.

Peter and the Jewish believers acted in a hypocritical way. To be hypocritical means to say one thing is true but then act like it is not true.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **hypocritical**. Look up hypocrisy in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul says that Peter and the Jewish believers were not obeying the true **gospel**. Gospel means "good news." The good news in the Bible is that God has made a way to save people. For more information on gospel, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for gospel as you used in previous passages.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 2:15–21 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In the last passage, Paul corrected Peter because Peter was acting in the wrong way. In this passage, Paul explains why Peter's actions were wrong. Peter was acting like people need to follow the law to have a right relationship with God. But people have a right relationship with God because of what Christ did, not because those people follow the law. It is impossible to have a right relationship with God by following the law. This is true for both the Jews and the Gentiles.

Throughout this passage, Paul discusses why the believers have a right relationship with God. First, Paul reminds Peter of the good news that Paul and Peter had already agreed on. When a person believes in Christ, Christ accepts that person, and it does not matter if that person is a Jew or a Gentile. The Jewish believers agree and know this to be true.

It was a special privilege to have parents who were Jews, because it meant you were a Jew too. Jews were God's special people whom God had chosen and given his law to. This law is the law of Moses. Jews called the Gentiles sinners because the Gentiles did not have or follow the law. But even the Jewish believers knew this law was not enough. When the Jews believed in Jesus, those Jews showed that the law was not enough to save them. The Jews, like the Gentiles, are sinners who need God to save them.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Who are some different people groups that live in your area? What do those people groups think about each other? How would those groups refer to each other? Pause this audio here.

God justifies Jewish believers by faith, just like God justifies the Gentiles by faith. When God justifies a person, God says that person is righteous. This means that the person has a right relationship with God. People have a right relationship with God by faith, which means they believe the good news about Jesus Christ and trust in and dedicate themselves to Jesus. People cannot earn God's approval by obeying the law. People cannot always obey all of God's law. People can never earn God's approval. God is the one who justifies a person. The law cannot do that. God justifies the people who trust in Christ, and the people who trust in Christ no longer have to follow the law!

Paul knows this is different than what the Jewish believers have learned. Paul knows that people will be confused. Jews believe that people who do not obey the law are Gentiles, or sinners. People may think the believers are then sinners. This may seem as if Christ causes people to become sinners.

But this is not true! If people go back to obeying the law to earn God's approval, then those people reject Christ and do not believe that Christ is the only one who can save. That is what makes people sinners. It is like those people are saying that what Christ has done is not enough, and now those people are going to earn God's acceptance, as if those people can do more than Christ already did for them. Paul stopped believing that Paul could earn God's favor through obeying the law. Paul has stopped or destroyed that way of living like a person destroys a building. If Paul starts to believe that again, it will be like Paul rebuilds that building.

Stop here and discuss as a group: Think of an activity that you completely stopped doing a long time ago. Discuss all the things you no longer have that you would need to do that activity, such as the tools, time, or strength to do that activity. What would you compare the way that you have completely stopped this activity to? Pause this audio here.

Paul says the law no longer has authority over Paul. It is like Paul has died to the law. When someone dies to something, that thing no longer controls that person. Just like you cannot control or rule over a dead person, the law cannot control or rule over Paul anymore. Paul does not trust in the law to save Paul, and the law does not show Paul how to live.

Paul says that the law itself is actually the reason that the law no longer has control over Paul. When the law had authority over Paul, Paul did not keep the entire law. Paul's punishment, according to the law, was to die. But Christ died to pay that penalty so that Paul did not have to die. When Paul put his faith in or trusted Christ, Christ's death counted as Paul's death. According to the law, it is as if Paul died. But now, since it is like Paul is dead, the law does not apply to Paul because the law does not apply to dead people. No one can accuse Paul of breaking the law. Thus, the law, and how Christ obeyed the law's requirement for punishment, is why the law does not apply to Paul anymore.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about the laws that you obey. Who has to obey these laws? Why do those people obey these laws? What kind of people do not have to obey these laws? Think about people who live far, far away from you. Do those people have to obey these laws? Why or why not? Pause this audio here.

And Paul no longer lives like Paul used to. Paul no longer tries to obey the law to earn a good relationship with God. Now, Christ lives in Paul. Christ is the one who causes Paul to have a right relationship with God. And in this new life, Christ does not encourage Paul to sin. Instead, Paul lives for God. When a person lives for God, that person has a right relationship with God and does what God wants. Paul does this by depending on Christ. This is what it means when Paul says he lives by faith in the Son of God. The title "Son of God" both shows that Jesus is God and describes the close bond between Jesus and God the Father. Jesus loves Paul and willingly died in order to help Paul.

Stop here and tell a story about someone you love very deeply so that you want to make this person happy and do what pleases this person. Discuss how you feel when you do something for this person whom you love, even if you do something difficult! Pause this audio here.

The Jews may think that Paul is rejecting God's grace or kindness when Paul rejects the law. The Jews believed that God showed grace to people when God gave them the law. But Paul is saying that God's grace is actually the way that Christ died to save Paul. Instead of needing to obey all the laws to be righteous or to have good standing with God, people need to have faith in Christ. Paul will not reject God's grace by returning to obey the law.

Paul is saying that the law does not do what the Jews think it does. The law is good, but the law does not make us right with God. If the law could make us right with God, Christ would not have needed to die. But Christ did die, which shows that the law could not make us right with God.

The Jewish believers who insist that people obey the law reject God's grace. These people act like God will accept them only if they obey the Jewish laws. These Jewish believers act like Christ's death was not enough to save them. It is like these believers are saying that Christ's death was useless!

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 2:15–21 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has four parts.

**In the first part:** Paul says that people have a right relationship with God because of what Christ did, not because those people follow the law. It is impossible for people to earn a right relationship with God by following the law.

**In the second part:** People may wonder if Christ causes people to be sinners like the Gentiles, since believers no longer follow the law. Paul says this is absolutely not true. People sin when they reject the way Christ saves them, and people try once again to save themselves when they follow the law.

**In the third part:** Paul explains that the law has no control over Paul anymore. It is like Paul is dead because Paul died with Christ. Now, Paul lives for God. Christ lives in Paul, so Paul lives by faith in Jesus, the Son of God.

**In the fourth part:** Paul says that Paul is not rejecting the grace of God when Paul does not follow the law. Anyone who tries to earn a right relationship with God through God's law actually rejects God's grace and says that Christ's death was useless!

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Jewish believers, including those in Antioch and Galatia, as well as Peter
* The Gentiles
* Jesus Christ, the Son of God
* And God

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Remember that at the end of the last passage, Paul told Peter that Peter was acting in the wrong way. Paul explains in this passage why Peter's way of acting was so wrong. This explanation is both for Peter and the Jewish believers in Antioch, as well as for the Galatians. This is also when Paul introduces his main idea, which Paul will talk about for the rest of the book. Paul has been telling these stories to prepare to talk about Paul's main idea. This explanation is both the end of Paul's stories and the beginning of the section where Paul talks to the Galatians about their problem. So it is not clear when Paul finishes his actual response to Peter and begins to talk just to the Galatians.

Stop here and discuss as a group: As an activity, have someone in the group ask a question. Then someone else in the group can answer that question by telling a story about a time when they answered that question. The storyteller can describe the situation and then give the answer that they gave at the time. Discuss how the storyteller's answer is both a part of the story and a response to the person in the group who asked the question. Pause this audio here.

In the first part, Paul says, "We who are Jews know this." You will remember that in the last passage, Paul talked about the time Paul confronted Peter in Antioch. In that story, Paul talked about himself, Peter, and the other Jewish believers. But now, since Paul is also writing this to the Galatians, Paul also includes the Jewish believers in Galatia. Paul and the others were Jews by birth, which means their parents were Jews. Paul calls the Gentiles "sinners" here, like the Jews do. Jews thought they were better than the Gentiles and so called the Gentiles "sinners." Paul criticizes or mocks the way the Jews call the Gentiles "sinners," because Paul and the believers know that all people are sinners.

However, Paul says that when Paul and the Jewish believers believed in Christ, they all agreed that the law could not cause them to have a right relationship with God. Only when people have faith in or trust Christ does God justify people. Paul repeats this several times because this is very important. Right now, the Galatians are adding a requirement to faith. The Galatians say that people must have faith in Jesus *and* obey the law. Paul wants the Galatians to understand that people cannot be in right standing because of the law, so there is no reason for people to obey the law in order to get a right relationship with God.

In the second part, Paul knows that the Jews will think that the Jewish believers are sinners like the Gentiles are sinners. The believers seek or want God to justify them in Christ. This means the same thing as how God justifies people by faith in Christ. But because the Jewish believers are not obeying the law, the Jews would find or consider the Jewish believers to be sinners, like the Gentiles are sinners. Someone could ask if this means that Christ encourages people to become sinners. Paul includes this question to show how it is not true. So that no one is confused, Paul immediately says, "That is certainly not true!"

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, what are some strong ways to say that something is not true? As an activity, have people say silly statements that are not true, like, "People must eat only dirt." Other members of the group can respond with phrases in your language to say that this is not true. Pause this audio here.

Paul says that the one who returns to obey the law is a transgressor, or sinner, not the person who follows Christ. Paul explains it by talking about what it would be like if Paul started to follow the law again. Paul is using himself as an example. This would be true for anyone, especially people like Peter, who have already started to follow the law again. But Paul may be using himself as an example to be polite. Paul has stopped or destroyed the way Paul obeyed the law, like a person destroys a building. If Paul starts to believe again that the law gives Paul a good relationship with God, it will be like Paul rebuilds that building. If Paul did, Paul would be a sinner.

Stop here and discuss how you want to translate the way Paul compares the way Paul does not obey the law with the way a person destroys a house. Pause this audio here.

In the third part, Paul continues to talk about what Paul has experienced to show what is true for all believers. Paul shows how Christ frees Paul from the law, just like a dead person is free from the law. Paul often uses this comparison to show that those things no longer control a person. Paul also says that Paul died with Christ on the cross. Paul did not physically die at the same time as Christ. Paul means that when Christ died, it was as if Paul died too, because Paul is free and no longer lives as Paul used to live.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how would you say that something no longer has control over you? Discuss how you want to translate the way that Paul says Paul dies to the law. Pause this audio here.

Then Paul says Paul no longer lives, but Christ lives in Paul. Paul does not mean that Christ controls Paul's body while Paul is dead. Paul means that Christ is the source of Paul's life. Like a man who has died, Paul is free from the way Paul used to live to earn God's favor. Paul's old self, or old way of living, was no longer living. Now, Paul lives because Christ lives in Paul and causes Paul to have right standing with God. Whatever Paul does while he lives on earth, Paul does it by faith or while trusting in Jesus, the Son of God.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do you talk about the way that someone no longer lives in the old way of life, but now lives completely differently? As an activity, tell a story about someone who was in jail for some time but eventually left jail as a free person. Imagine you were that person who was in jail and then left jail. How would you feel in jail, and then how would you feel after you left? How would you live differently outside of jail than the way you would live in jail? Discuss how you will translate the way that Paul no longer lives, but lets Christ live in Paul. Pause this audio here.

In the fourth part, Paul says he will not reject God's grace. Paul then talks about a situation that is not real. Paul says that if the way people obey the law could make people right with God, then Christ died for no reason. But the law cannot save people, and Christ did save people when Christ died. Paul is saying that the way Peter, the Jewish believers in Antioch, and the believers in Galatia are acting and following the law is wrong.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, when you describe an impossible situation, how do you show that you do not believe it is true? As an activity, describe what your life would be like if you had not done something important, such as if you had not married your spouse or worked a certain job. Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

You can pick objects that you can stack, like bricks or boxes, to represent God's law. The person who plays the Jews can carry the objects that represent God's law, to show how the Jews try to obey God's law. However, have the Jews with the law stand away from the person who represents God, because the law does not give people a good relationship with God. The person who plays the believers does not hold the objects that represent God's law. The person who plays Jesus can lead the believers to stand near God, because the way believers trust in Jesus causes those people to have a good relationship with God. You can stack up the items that represent the law around Paul, to show how Paul was not free with the law. Paul can knock down the objects that represent the law and walk over to Jesus to show how Paul now trusts in Jesus. Paul does not rebuild the wall that Paul knocked down! You can act out the way Jesus died on the cross, and Paul can pretend like Paul dies too. When God causes Jesus to live again, you can have Jesus stand up and move around, like a person who lives. Then Jesus can cause Paul to live and stand up again, too. Paul lives because Christ lives! Jesus can lead Paul to stand near God because Jesus causes Paul to have a good relationship with God.

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 2:15–21 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has four parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Jewish believers, including those in Antioch and Galatia, as well as Peter
* The Gentiles
* Jesus Christ, the Son of God
* And God

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "We are Jews because our parents were Jews. We are not Gentile sinners who do not follow the law. However, we know that God does not justify people because they obey the law. God justifies people because those people have faith in Christ Jesus. That is why we also, like the Gentiles, have believed in Christ Jesus, so that God will justify us because of our belief in Christ. God does not justify us because we obey the law. We have believed in Christ because God does not justify anyone because they obey the law."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing the Jewish believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I was always thankful that my parents were Jews and not Gentiles. My parents started to tell me about God even when I was little. I did not have to discover who God was on my own; or
* When I heard about Jesus, I understood that I needed Jesus to save me. I did not realize until now that when I trusted in Jesus, I stopped trusting in the law to save me; or
* I understand that we agreed that we needed Jesus when we trusted in Jesus. But I am worried that if I stop obeying the law, I will be a sinner like the Gentiles. That is what I learned all my life. It is really hard to change something that I thought was true and always believed!

Ask the person playing God, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am sad that people do not understand why I gave them the law. If I gave them the law so that they can earn my acceptance, that would be very cruel, since no one does enough to earn that; or
* I want to declare people as righteous so that I can have a good and close relationship with those people! That is why I sent Jesus to save people; or
* I chose the Jewish people to be my special people so that they could prepare and look forward to the Savior, who is Jesus. Now, all people who have faith in Jesus are my special people.

Continue the drama.

Paul says, "If we want God to justify us by our faith in Christ, then people consider us to be sinners like the Gentiles. If we are sinners, people may say that Christ made us sinners. But it is certainly not true! What I mean is, if I return to obeying the law so that God will justify me, it is as if I rebuild a building that I had destroyed. By doing that, I would show that I did not obey the law.

"It is as if I died to the law, so the law no longer has power over me. Now I live for God and do what God wants. It is like I have died with Christ on the cross. It is as if I am not alive, but Christ is alive in me. The life that I now live in my body, I live by trusting in the Son of God. Christ loved me so much that he willingly died on my behalf. I do not refuse the grace of God like those who return to obeying the law. If obeying the law could make a person right with God, then it was useless for Christ to die."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Christ, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I want people to live for God. When people live for God, those people have a good relationship with God. Then those people feel joy and peace and love one another. This is a good and wonderful way to live! or
* I know that people cannot live for God on their own. People cannot have a good relationship with God on their own! That is why I died to save people and now help them as they live; or
* I love people so deeply that I chose to let people dishonor me and kill me. I even accepted all the punishment that everyone else deserved.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am so thankful that Christ died in my place. Instead of dying forever, I get to enjoy a good relationship with God, starting now and lasting forever! or
* The believers cannot live for God on their own. If the believers start to obey the law again, they start to think that they can live for God with their own strength. The believers need to remember that we depend on Christ for everything, especially the way we live! or
* The believers insult Christ when they rely on the law. The believers are acting like Christ did not do enough to save them!

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 2:15–21 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul, Peter, and some of the believers in both Antioch and Galatia are **Jews**. Jews are the descendants of Jacob. For more information on Jew, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Jew as you used in previous passages.

The Jews say the **Gentiles** are sinners. The word Gentile refers to all people who are not Jews. Sin is an act of rebellion against God. A sinner is someone who continues to do sin. Jews used the phrase "Gentile Sinners" to refer to anyone who was not a Jew and to show that the Jews were better than the Gentiles. For more information on Gentile, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Gentile as you used in previous passages.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **sinners**. Look up sin in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

The law does not justify people. God justifies people by faith in Jesus Christ. In the Bible, when people talk about the law, they mean the set of instructions that God has given the people of Israel. God gave the Israelites his laws through a man named Moses.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **law**. Look up law in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

When a person justifies someone, he declares that person not guilty. When God declares a person not guilty, that means the person is righteous and has a right relationship with God.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **justify**. Look up justify in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

God justifies people by **faith** in Jesus Christ. Faith means to rely on someone, to trust and believe that what that person says is true. This specific faith is the way people believe in Jesus. That person believes that Jesus is the Son of God and trusts that Jesus has died for their sins and that God has forgiven and accepted that person. For more information on faith, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for faith as you used in previous passages.

**Christ** is a title for Jesus that reminds the believers that Jesus is the Messiah, or the Savior and king that God chose to come and rescue people. For more information on Christ, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Christ as you used in previous passages.

Paul says that Paul was crucified or died on a cross with Christ. When someone crucifies someone, they kill that person on a cross. People used a cross as a tool to torture and execute people they thought were the worst criminals.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **crucifixion** or **die on a cross**. Look up cross in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul lives by faith in the **Son of God.** The Son of God is a title for Jesus. Jesus is called the Son of God because Jesus has a special relationship with God the Father. God and Jesus love each other in the way that a father and a son love each other. This title also shows that Jesus is God, too. For more information on Son of God, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Son of God as you used in previous passages.

Paul will not treat God's **grace** as meaningless. God gives people grace when God is kind to people, even though those people do not deserve God's kindness. For more information on grace, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for grace as you used in previous passages.

Paul says that if the way we obey the law could make us righteous, then Christ did not need to die. Someone who is righteous behaves in the right way. Only a righteous person can have a good relationship with God. When people trust in Jesus, God declares that those people are righteous.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **righteous**. Look up righteousness in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 3:1–9 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In the last passage, Paul declared that God justifies people by faith, not because people obey the law. Paul rebukes the Galatians in this passage because the Galatians have forgotten how and why God justifies people. Paul continues to show that God justifies people by faith. To do so, Paul reminds the Galatians of what the Galatians have experienced, what Abraham experienced, and what God has said in the Scriptures.

To begin this passage, Paul sharply rebukes the Galatians. Paul says the Galatians are foolish because the Galatians are not using their minds like they should. Though the Galatians know about Christ, the Galatians are not thinking clearly and are listening to false teaching. Paul is deeply concerned for the Galatians and frustrated that the Galatians are choosing to believe something false when they know the truth!

Paul asks if someone has bewitched or put a magical spell on the Galatians. No one actually put a spell on the Galatians. Paul does not even really think that. Paul is just saying that the Galatians act in such a surprising way that it is as if someone put a spell on the Galatians to make them act in a way the Galatians would not normally act.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what do people believe about spells? If a person put a spell on someone else, how would that other person act? Pause this audio here.

The way the Galatians act is surprising because Paul very clearly taught the Galatians about Jesus. Good teachers like Paul could describe stories and events in a way people could easily understand and remember. Paul talked about Jesus with such detail that it was like the Galatians had actually seen Jesus on the cross with their own eyes. So the Galatians completely understand how and why Jesus died on the cross to make them right with God.

Paul then asks the Galatian believers several questions so that the believers will think about the way they are acting and thinking. Paul reminds the Galatian believers that they received the Spirit, which is the Holy Spirit, because they believed the gospel when they heard it, *not* because they obeyed the law! Again, Paul shows how amazed and disappointed Paul is at how the Galatians are acting when Paul calls the Galatians foolish.

The Galatians are foolish because, though they have the Spirit to help them, the Galatians are trying to do things on their own. Paul reminds the Galatians that their lives as believers began when the Galatians received the Holy Spirit. When people start to follow Jesus, the Holy Spirit works in their lives to help them behave more and more like Jesus. But now the Galatians are trying to finish, or live the rest of their lives, by the flesh. Flesh is the soft part of a person's body. Paul uses the word flesh to refer to the sinful nature or the way that people live without Jesus. This sinful way of living is the way that the Galatians are trying to obey the law. When the Galatians follow the law, the Galatians think that God will justify them because of their own effort. But God justifies people because those people believe in Jesus, and the Holy Spirit is proof of that!

When the Galatians rely on their own effort, the Galatians no longer trust Jesus. The Galatians act like everything they have experienced means nothing to the Galatians. It is hard for Paul to believe that the Galatians would act like this!

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Imagine that someone is learning a new activity, like a sport, a job, or a skill, from a very good teacher. This teacher is giving the student good advice, equipment, and encouragement, and is guiding the student to do difficult parts of the training. Now imagine the student decides to stop listening to the teacher and tries to do everything on their own. In fact, the student does completely different things than the teacher taught them! How well do you think the student will be able to do this activity? Pause this audio here.

Again, Paul asks the Galatians to remember that God works among the Galatians because the Galatians believed in Jesus when they heard the good news about Jesus. Because the Galatians believed, God gave the Galatians his Spirit, who is the Holy Spirit. God works miracles among the Galatians, which means God does amazing things like healing people. God does not do this because the Galatians obeyed the law, but because the Galatians believed what they heard about Jesus!

Paul then talks about Abraham to prove that God justifies people because those people trust in Jesus. Abraham is an important ancestor of the Jewish people. Paul uses Abraham as an example because the Jews respect Abraham. Paul says that the Jews do not understand how God justified Abraham, or accepted Abraham as righteous. God did not justify Abraham because of how Abraham followed the law. In fact, God justified Abraham before God told people God's law, and before anyone even circumcised Abraham! God justified Abraham because Abraham had faith in God. Abraham believed that God would fulfill his promise, and Abraham committed himself to God, like believers do now.

Stop here and, as a group, think of some people in your culture who you would use as a good example of how people should live. Think of people whom many other people would know and respect. Discuss why you would use these people as an example. Pause this audio here.

The Jewish people are physically Abraham's descendants, and these people are proud to be in that group. If anyone wants to join the Jews and become children of Abraham, those people must follow the law. But Paul says that the real descendants of Abraham are not people who are related to Abraham or who follow the law. Abraham's descendants are people who act like Abraham and have faith in God. People who have faith like Abraham trust in God and live in a certain way because of that faith. Thus, Gentiles who trust in God can be, and are, a part of Abraham's family.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, why are people a part of a people group? If someone wanted to change people groups, how could that person do that? Why would someone want to be a part of a different people group? Pause this audio here.

God has always justified people because those people believe in God, and not because of what those people do. In the Scriptures, God announced the gospel, or God's plan to save people, to Abraham before it even happened. Here, Paul is talking about the part of the gospel that explains that God will justify people because of their faith, no matter if the person is a Jew or a Gentile. God told this to Abraham when God said that God would bless or show kindness to all people through Abraham. God does not give God's blessing just because someone is descended from a certain person, or because someone circumcised that person. God blesses both those people and Abraham because of their faith.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 3:1–9 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has two parts.

**In the first part:** Paul rebukes the Galatians for acting in a foolish way. Paul asks several questions to remind the Galatians of things they already know. The Galatians know that God gives the Galatians the Holy Spirit because they have faith. The Galatians also know it is useless to try to live by their own effort instead of with the Holy Spirit's help.

**In the second part:** Paul uses Abraham as an example to show that God justifies people because of their faith. God has always justified people because those people believe in God, not because of what they do. People who have faith are Abraham's real descendants, and God blesses those people along with Abraham.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* Jesus Christ
* The Holy Spirit
* God the Father
* Abraham
* The descendants of Abraham, who are the people who have faith
* Gentiles
* And all people groups

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

So far in this book, Paul has talked about how God gave Paul authority and how the gospel Paul teaches is really true. Now, Paul will begin to explain that people have a right relationship with God because of their faith and not because of what those people do. This is the true gospel that Paul has taught the Galatians and reminds them of now.

In this passage, Paul speaks to the Galatians directly and reminds the Galatians of their experiences. These experiences show that what Paul is saying is true and right. In this passage, Paul strongly expresses Paul's unbelief, surprise, and disappointment with the Galatians. Paul shows that Paul is very unhappy with the Galatians because the Galatians stopped trusting in Christ. Paul rebukes, or criticizes, the Galatians when Paul asks the Galatians a lot of questions. This was a popular way that people talked to challenge the people who listened to them. Paul is not really expecting the Galatians to send a message to Paul with answers to these questions. Instead, Paul wants the people to think about the answers to these questions themselves. If the Galatians responded honestly to Paul's questions, the Galatians would have to agree with Paul. The Galatians must realize that the Galatians know the truth and have acted foolishly.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: When you want to convince people of something, how do you get those people to think about something they already know? Discuss how you want to translate Paul's questions in this passage. The answers to Paul's questions would be so clear to the Galatians that Paul chooses not to include the answers to Paul's questions. You can add the answers, such as, "Did God give you his Spirit because you obey the law? No!" You can also make Paul's questions into strong statements, like, "God certainly did not give you his Spirit because you obey the law!" Pause this audio here.

In the first part, Paul begins with a harsh rebuke. Paul calls the Galatians foolish, or people who can think but do not. Paul wants to shock the Galatians so that the Galatians will realize that what they are doing is very wrong. Paul asks if someone bewitched the Galatians. Paul does not actually think that someone cast a spell on the Galatians. Paul compares how the Galatians listen to a person who teaches something that is not true to the way a person puts a spell on another person. This spell would cause the person to act in a completely different or surprising way.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how would you rebuke or criticize someone for acting in a foolish or stupid way? How would you describe someone who starts to act in a completely different way than they know they should act? Pause this audio here.

Paul compares the way that Paul very clearly taught about Jesus to the way that people can see things with their eyes. Paul emphasizes that the Galatians really did hear the truth about Jesus. Paul just mentions the way that Jesus died on a cross to refer to the whole good news about Jesus.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how would you describe the way that someone describes an event so clearly that it is like their listeners saw it too? Pause this audio here.

Paul then says that Paul wants to know something from the Galatians. Paul is not actually looking for information. Paul knows the answer to Paul's question. Paul is using the question to remind the Galatians of something the Galatians know too. The obvious reason the Galatians have the Spirit is not because the Galatians keep the law, but because the Galatians have faith in the gospel message. When Paul says "the Spirit," Paul is referring to the Holy Spirit.

Again, Paul rebukes the Galatians for acting foolishly when Paul asks how the Galatians can be so foolish. With his next question, Paul explains that it makes no sense to begin to live as a believer with the Spirit's help and then reject the Spirit to live on by one's own strength. If someone has the Holy Spirit, who is powerful, it is foolish to reject the Spirit! Notice how Paul compares the way that believers begin and end, or live their lives to the end of their lives. Paul also compares God's Spirit with our flesh or human strength. Paul often uses the word flesh to talk about people's way of living and effort when they do not listen to or obey God.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how would you describe the way that someone does things by themselves without help from anyone else? How do you talk about the way that people live when they do not obey or listen to God? Discuss how you want to translate flesh here. Paul will continue to talk about the flesh, or the way that people do what they want instead of what God wants, throughout Galatians. Pause this audio here.

Paul again asks a question to show how foolish it is for people to live this way. Everything the Galatians had experienced would be in vain, or useless, because the flesh cannot complete the work that the Spirit does. In other words, the Galatians started their life with God by God's power. But now the Galatians seem to want to use their own power, or their own ways, to live as believers! Finally, Paul asks about how God gives people God's Spirit. Again, Paul is emphasizing that the Galatians already know the answer to this question, even though the Galatians are living as if they do not.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how would you describe the way that someone does something, but their actions produce no result? Pause this audio here.

Paul has been talking about what the Galatians have experienced. Now, in the second part, Paul talks about Abraham's experience. Paul often referred to Abraham as an example of someone who believed in God. People would trust and accept Abraham's experiences as true and reliable, especially Jewish people. Since Paul is responding to what Jewish believers are thinking and doing, Paul uses Abraham as an example. Jewish believers would know Abraham's story. Paul will continue to do this for several sections.

Paul quotes from the Scriptures when Paul says that Abraham believed God and God considered Abraham to be righteous, or that God justified Abraham. Paul's listeners would know the words Paul is saying, so Paul does not say where Paul quotes from. Paul uses the Scriptures to show how Paul is not saying something new. This is what God has been saying and doing all along, and the Jewish believers know this to be true.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how would you quote something that many people would know? Pause this audio here.

Paul shows that God considers people to be righteous because of their faith, not because those people follow the law. Some translations say that the Scriptures announced this gospel or good news to Abraham. This means that the Scriptures tell the story of how God announced this good news. This good news is that God will bless all nations or all people groups because of Abraham. One of Abraham's descendants was Jesus, and Jesus did bless or show kindness to all people. Because of what Jesus did, all people can have a right relationship with God.

God blesses both the Gentiles and the Jews, so it does not make sense for the Jewish believers to follow the strict rules that made the Jewish people different from the Gentiles. In fact, Paul shows that these rules and laws are not really what cause people to be Abraham's descendants. It is actually people who act like Abraham who are Abraham's true descendants. The Jews think that God will bless them or show kindness to them because they are Abraham's descendants. But Paul says that God blesses people who are like Abraham, who have faith.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 3:1–9 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has two parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* Jesus Christ
* The Holy Spirit
* God the Father
* Abraham
* The descendants of Abraham, who are the people who have faith
* Gentiles
* And all people groups

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "You Galatians are so foolish! You should not have allowed someone to trick you! I clearly explained how and why people killed Jesus Christ on the cross. It was as if you had seen it with your own eyes. I want you to think about this: Did you receive the Spirit because you obeyed the law? Of course not! Instead, you received the Spirit because you believed what you heard. You should not be so foolish! You began to live for Jesus when you received the Holy Spirit. Now you are foolishly trying to finish by your own actions."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am surprised and upset by how the Galatians are acting. When I was with the Galatians, I could see that the Galatians understood and believed the truth about Jesus. But now the Galatians are acting in a completely different way; or
* I am worried about the Galatians. This foolish way the Galatians act will hurt them. I want the Galatians to realize that the way they are living is wrong; or
* The Galatians are acting as if they can do more than God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. This is a really foolish way to think and act! The Galatians are insulting God and what God has done.

Ask the person playing the Holy Spirit, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I want to help the Galatians! The Galatians cannot live in the right way on their own; or
* The Galatians are acting like I am not with them. The Galatians are ignoring me and the way I help them. Instead, the Galatians are trying to do things on their own; or
* I reassured the Galatians that Jesus saved them and that God justified them. Now, the Galatians act like God has not justified them yet. The Galatians are worried and think they have to do more. If the Galatians would just listen to me, I would reassure them that Jesus has done enough to save the Galatians!

Continue the drama.

Then Paul says, "Do not let everything you have experienced be for nothing. I do not believe that it was for nothing! Does God give you the Spirit and do amazing things among you because you obey the law? No, God does these things because you heard the good news and believed it."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing the Galatian believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* This way of thinking is different from the way I learned when I was growing up. I know Paul already told this to us, but it is hard to change the way I think; or
* We have seen the way that God works among us. I thought God was being kind to us because we were obeying the law. But I also remember the times that I fail to obey the law, and God is still kind to me; or
* I am a bit embarrassed when I hear Paul's words. I do know these things.

Continue the drama.

Paul says, "Think of Abraham. Abraham 'trusted God and God accepted him as righteous.' And so, you should understand that people who believe in Christ are really Abraham's descendants. In addition, Scripture shows that God knew ahead of time that God would justify the Gentiles because of their faith in Christ. God told this good news to Abraham before it happened. God said that God would bless all people because of Abraham. This means that God blesses everyone who believes in Christ, together with Abraham, who believed in God."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Abraham, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am so thankful for the way that God has shown kindness to me; or
* I choose to trust that God will do what God says he will do, even in difficult times; or
* I am amazed that God has spoken to me and chose to reveal things that will happen in the future.

Ask the person playing God, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I have always wanted all people to have a good relationship with me. Even when I chose Abraham and the Jewish people to be my special people, I chose them so they could bless others, too; or
* I know people cannot do enough to earn right standing with me. So instead, I ask people to believe or have faith in me. Then I will justify those people and give them my Spirit to help them live.

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 3:1–9 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul says it is like someone has bewitched or cast an evil spell on the Galatians.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **bewitched**, or **cast an evil spell**. Pause this audio here.

The Galatians clearly heard about how people **crucified** Jesus Christ. When someone crucifies someone, they kill that person on a cross. People used a cross as a tool to torture and execute people they thought were the worst criminals. For more information on crucify, refer to crucifixion in the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for crucified as you used in previous passages.

**Christ** is a title for Jesus that reminds the believers that Jesus is the Messiah, or the Savior and king whom God chose to come and rescue people. For more information on Christ, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Christ as you used in previous passages.

The Galatians received the Spirit when they believed what they heard about Jesus. The Spirit or the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit makes it possible for people to become followers of Jesus. When people start to follow Jesus, the Holy Spirit works in those people's hearts to help them behave more and more like Jesus, to make them more and more holy. The Holy Spirit is not just a power but also a person.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for the **Spirit**. Look up Holy Spirit in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

The Galatians did not receive the Spirit because they obeyed the **law**. In the Bible, when people talk about the law, they mean the set of instructions that God gave the people of Israel. For more information on law, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for law as you used in previous passages.

Though the believers have the Spirit to help them, the believers are trying to live by the **flesh**. Flesh is the soft part of a person's body between the bones and the skin. Paul uses the word flesh to mean the sinful way that people live without Jesus. When someone does something by the flesh, that person is doing things their own way and with their own strength or ability. When people become believers, those people live by the Spirit, which means they do what God wants with the help of the Holy Spirit.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for the **flesh**. Look up flesh in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

God works miracles among the believers because the believers have believed in the gospel they heard. A miracle is something that happens that is very unusual and surprising and seems impossible. God performs miracles to show the people that God is powerful and that the people can trust God.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **miracle**. Look up miracle in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

When Abraham believed in God, God credited it to Abraham as **righteousness**. This means that God justified Abraham, or declared that Abraham was righteous. Someone who is righteous is behaving in the right way. Only a righteous person can have a good relationship with God. For more information on righteousness, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for righteous as you used in previous passages.

People who have **faith** are children of Abraham. Faith means to rely on someone, to trust and believe that what that person says is true. This specific faith is the way people believe in Jesus. For more information on faith, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for faith as you used in previous passages.

God promised that Abraham's children or descendants would be God's people. A person's descendants are his children, grandchildren, and all future generations from the same family line. The Jewish people are Abraham's descendants by family line. But Paul says that Abraham's children, or the people God chooses and blesses, are the people who have faith in God.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **children** or **descendants**. Look up descendants in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

The Scriptures have the story of when God announced that God would justify the Gentiles. When people in the New Testament talk about the Scripture, or the Scriptures, they are talking about the part of the Bible that believers now call the Old Testament.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **Scriptures**. Look up Scriptures in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

God announced that he would **justify** the Gentiles. When a person justifies someone, he declares that person not guilty. When God declares a person not guilty, that means the person is righteous and has a right relationship with God. For more information on justify, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for justify as you used in previous passages.

The word **Gentile** refers to all people who are not Jews. For more information on Gentile, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Gentile as you used in previous passages.

God announced the **gospel** in advance to Abraham. Here, Paul uses the word gospel to refer to the way that God justifies people because of their faith in God, no matter if the person is a Jew or a Gentile. At that time, God did not tell Abraham the story of how Jesus would die and live again. For more information on gospel, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for gospel as you used in previous passages.

God said that God would bless all nations because of Abraham. A nation is a group of people who belong together and who live in the same country. Whenever someone in the Bible talks about "all the nations of the earth," this is another way of saying "all the people who live on earth."

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **nation**. Look up nation in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

God blesses the people like Abraham who have faith. When God blesses a person, God does, or promises to do, something good for that person.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **bless**. Look up bless in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there.

Setting the Stage

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 3:10–14 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In the last passage, Paul reminded the Galatians that God justifies people because of their faith, just like God justified Abraham because Abraham trusted God. Now, Paul will talk about people who want God to justify them because those people obey the law. Because those people cannot obey all of the law, there is a curse on those people. Christ freed people from that curse when Christ died on the cross. Instead of a curse, people can receive the Spirit and share the blessing God gave Abraham. This blessing is that people can have a good relationship with God!

First, Paul talks about the people who try to obey the law in order to be right with God. These people are under a curse. When God gave the Jewish people the law, the Jewish people agreed to obey the law. If people obeyed the law, God would bless those people. But God warned his people that God would curse or punish anyone who did not completely obey the law. Since no human being can obey the law perfectly, God's curse applies to all people who try to obey the law.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture or land, what kind of laws must people follow? What happens when people obey these laws? What happens when people disobey these laws? Do you know anyone who perfectly obeys all the laws all the time? Pause this audio here.

Paul explains that God does not justify people because those people obey the law. Paul quotes from the Scriptures to show that God makes people righteous because of the way people have faith in God. And because God has justified those people, or made them righteous, those people will live. This means more than just living on Earth. Here, Paul is referring to being in a good relationship with God. Paul means living for and with God both here on Earth and after death.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what do you believe about people who have a good relationship with God or gods? What does the god do for that person? Pause this audio here.

The way a person obeys the law is not at all the same as the way a person trusts God. People receive righteousness because of their faith, but the law is not about faith. When God made his agreement with the Jewish people, God promised that a person who obeys the laws will live well. Here, this just means to have a good life on Earth. This is different from the good life that God gives people because of their faith. And since people cannot obey the law perfectly, people cannot even fully earn this good life on Earth. These people just receive the curse for failing to obey the law!

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Describe someone you know who lives in a good, comfortable way on Earth, with everything that person needs to live. What kinds of good things does that person have or experience? How can this be different from the way someone who has a good relationship with God lives? Pause this audio here.

But Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law. To redeem means to release a prisoner or a slave because you paid the price to free that person. The price Christ paid to release us was to take our place and suffer the curse of the law or punishment for breaking the law. This is what we deserved. But because of Christ, that curse does not apply to believers anymore. This is what Paul means when Paul says Christ became a curse or took on the curse.

Again, Paul explains why Paul says this with a quote from the Scriptures. In that time, to punish a person who did a terrible crime, people would kill that person who did the crime. Then people would hang that dead person's body on a tree or pole so all people could see the body. This would remind people that sin was horrible and bad. Everyone would see the curse or punishment for sin. Paul shows that this verse applies to Christ. In the Old Testament, people only hung a person on a tree after the person died. But by the time of Christ, people hung a living person on a tree or cross to kill them. When people crucified Christ, they hung Christ's body on a cross, which people made from a tree. This was God's way of showing us that Christ took the curse or punishment for our sin.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, when someone has done a very terrible crime, how do other people punish that person? How do people show that the crime was a very bad thing to do? Pause this audio here.

Christ did this so that people, including the Gentiles, could share the blessing that God gave to Abraham. God gave this blessing through a promise that has no curse! God blessed Abraham when God justified Abraham because of Abraham's faith. God did not require Abraham to obey laws. In the same way, God justifies Gentiles who believe in Jesus because of their faith, not because those Gentiles obey the laws. God gives the Holy Spirit to those people who believe in Jesus Christ, just like God promised he would. This is all possible because of what Christ did and the way people have faith in Christ.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 3:10–14 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul explains that the way people try to obey the law does not make those people righteous. Instead, people who try and fail to obey the law receive a curse.

**In the second part:** Paul explains that God justifies people because of their faith and causes those people to really live well because they have a good relationship with God. When people obey the law, then people just live well here on Earth.

**In the third part:** Christ saves people from the curse of the law. Christ saves people so that believers can receive the Holy Spirit and the blessing God gave to Abraham.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* People who try to obey the law to become righteous
* God
* Righteous people
* Christ Jesus
* Abraham
* And the Holy Spirit

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

At the end of the last passage, Paul said that God blesses people who trust God or have faith. Now Paul explains that God judges or curses people who try and fail to follow the law. Paul is comparing people who have faith to people who follow the law. Paul quotes several parts of the Scriptures, or the Old Testament, to show that this is the way that God has always treated people who obey the law and people who have faith. Paul quotes from the books of Deuteronomy, Habakkuk, and Leviticus. The people in Galatia would probably be familiar with the Scriptures that Paul quotes, so Paul does not explain where Paul is quoting from. Sometimes, the quote is so familiar that Paul does not even say that Paul is quoting something.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, what are some quotes or sayings that everyone is very familiar with? How do you say these quotes? When are some times when you would say a quote without announcing that you are quoting someone else? Discuss how you want to show that Paul is quoting from the Scriptures in this section. You can add phrases such as, "We know from the Scriptures." Pause this audio here.

In the first part, Paul talks about those who rely on the works of the law. These are the people who rely on the way they obey the law to earn a right relationship with God. Paul quotes from the story that tells how God gave the laws to the Jewish people. This quote is about everyone who does not obey the Book of the Law completely. When God told the laws to Moses, Moses wrote these laws in the first five books of the Old Testament. Since these books are about the law, people sometimes call these books the Book of the Law. Anyone who does not do everything in the Book of the Law is under God's curse. This means that God condemns or judges these people to be wrong and punishes or curses these people. A curse is the opposite of a blessing. No one can follow everything in the law. So everyone who depends on the way they obey the law lives under a curse.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, what words or phrases do you use to talk about the punishment someone deserves for breaking a law? Discuss how you want to translate the word curse to show that it is a punishment, which is the opposite of a blessing. Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul explains with another quote that God does not justify people because those people obey the law. God makes people righteous because of their faith and causes them to really live. These people have a good relationship with God and will live with God after they die. Paul quotes another part of the Scriptures that shows that the law only gives people a good life on this Earth. This is not the same thing as righteousness or a good relationship with God that starts now and continues after people die. Because the law is not based on the way that people have faith, but instead on the way people obey, God does not justify people because they obey the law.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Paul talks about how people who obey the law can live well now on Earth. This is different from the way that people who have faith live well both now and after they die because they have a good relationship with God! Discuss how you will talk about these two ways of living in order to show how they are different. Pause this audio here.

In the third part, Paul talks about how Christ redeems or saves people from the curse of the law. When you redeem a person, you free that person from debt or slavery. Christ did not pay anything to anyone for us. But Christ did offer his own life in our place, like a person offers payment, to make us free from the curse.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Imagine you broke something, and as a punishment, you had to fix that thing. Now imagine that someone else decided to help you and fixed that thing for you. How would you describe the way that person helped or saved you from that punishment? Discuss how you want to translate the way that Christ redeemed or saved us. Pause this audio here.

Paul again quotes from the Scriptures to show how Christ does this. The quote talks about people whom other people hang on a tree or pole. A cross can be in that category, because people make crosses out of wood from trees. If people hang someone on a tree, it shows that God has punished or cursed that person. Paul says that when Christ died on the cross, Christ became a curse. This means that Christ takes, or himself experiences, the curse that people deserve. Christ does this to redeem us from the law agreement, where we receive a curse because of what we do or do not do.

Instead of the law with a curse, God gives us a promise with a blessing. This blessing has no curse, since Christ became the curse and took any punishment we deserved. This blessing is the same blessing God gave to Abraham. In this promise with a blessing, God justifies believers because of their faith. And God also gives believers God's Spirit to show that people have a right relationship with God. This is possible through Christ or because of what Christ did.

Stop here and discuss how you want to translate the way that Christ became a curse for us. In your language, how would you describe the way that someone completely takes responsibility for something so that another person does not have to experience it at all? As an activity, find an object that you would normally kill or destroy. Then find a replacement for that object. For example, maybe there is a piece of wood that you would normally throw in the fire. But instead, you choose another piece of wood to take its place so that the first piece of wood is safe from the fire. Then discuss the way that Christ saves us from more than just something painful, like a fire. Talk about the many things Christ saves us from! Talk about how your lives are different because Christ has saved you. Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 3:10–14 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* People who try to obey the law to become righteous
* God
* Righteous people
* Christ Jesus
* Abraham
* And the Holy Spirit

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "Anyone who tries to obey the law to please God will receive a curse. We know from the Scriptures that 'God curses anyone who does not obey all the commandments that Moses wrote in the law books.' Now it is clear that God does not declare a person righteous because that person obeys the law. We know from the Scriptures that \*\*'\*\*It is through faith that a righteous person has life.' There is a difference between the person who obeys the law and the person who has faith in God. We know from the Scriptures that, 'The person who obeys all the commandments will have a good life because he obeyed the commandments.'"

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing God, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I did not give the people the law so that they could earn right standing with me. That would be cruel, because no one could earn right standing with me. It would be like I gave people an impossible task so they could fail! I gave the people the law because it is the best way to live. The law shows people how to have peace with each other and live good lives on Earth; or
* I justify people because of the kind way I want to act towards people, not because of the way people act. I do this because I love people and know they can never do enough to earn this. I want people to trust me and know that I can do enough to make them righteous.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I do not want the believers to think that God is changing his mind with this new system. I want people to understand that God is consistent and that God does not break his promises or agreements. That is why I am quoting Scripture: to show that this is the way God has always acted; or
* I am so thankful for the way that God has explained the truth to me. I know it is confusing to the Galatians, and at one time, it was confusing to me too! But God is kind, and when we are confused, God's Spirit helps us understand.

Continue the drama.

Then Paul says, "But now, Christ has freed us from the curse we receive because we do not obey the law. Christ took on our curse. We read in the Scriptures that 'if people hang someone on a tree, it shows that God has cursed that person.' Christ redeemed us so that the Gentiles would receive the blessing of Abraham through Jesus Christ. Christ redeemed us so that we would receive the Holy Spirit that God promised to give to us because of our faith."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Christ Jesus, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* People deserve the curse and punishment because of the way they acted. But since I love people, just like God the Father does, I will save people from their punishment. I will do this in a way that is just and right; or
* I want people to have a right relationship with God, so I have done what would be impossible for people. Now people can have a blessing instead of the curse. People just need to trust in me and what I have done!

Ask the person playing the Galatian believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* This is all very hard to understand! I am thankful that God's Spirit is with me and helps me when I hear new or important things; or
* When the Jews talked about the consequences of not obeying the law, I was scared, so I started to obey the law. But I never felt like I did enough. When I hear Paul say that Christ has taken the curse for us, I am so relieved and thankful; or
* I thought that if we did not obey the law, then we were ignoring something that God said to do. Now I see that Christ freed us from that old way of doing things. God is still consistent while he shows us such kindness. I am glad that I serve a God who works things out so well.

Ask the person playing the Holy Spirit, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I care about the believers and will help them every single day; or
* I rejoice when a person trusts in Jesus! I am so glad to be with the believers.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 3:10–14 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul talks about people who rely on obeying the **law**. This is the set of instructions that God has given the people of Israel. God gave the Israelites his laws through a man named Moses. Since Moses wrote down the law in a book, sometimes people call it the "Book of the Law." In this time, people wrote on long sheets that people made out of plants or the skin of an animal. People would roll up these long sheets around a stick. People would call these books or "scrolls." For more information on law and the Book of the Law, refer to law and Scriptures in the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for law as you used in previous passages.

These people are under a **curse**. When you curse someone, you wish that something bad will happen to that person. When God curses someone, the bad thing that God says will happen will certainly happen. God curses people to punish those people. God told the Israelites that if they obeyed God, God would bless the Israelites. But if the Israelites disobeyed God, God would curse the Israelites. For more information on curse, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for curse as you used in previous passages

Paul quotes from the Scriptures frequently in this passage. When people in the New Testament talk about the Scripture, or the Scriptures, they mean the part of the Bible that believers now call the Old Testament. Sometimes people talked about something from the Scriptures without saying the word "Scriptures." Everybody knew that if you said "it is written," you meant something that was written in the Scriptures.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will show when Paul is quoting from the **Scriptures**. If you choose to use the word Scripture, remember that Scriptures is in the Master Glossary and use the same word that you have used in previous passages. Pause this audio here.

God does not **justify** people because those people obey the law, but because of their faith. When God justifies someone, God declares that person not guilty. That means the person is righteous and has a right relationship with God. For more information on justify, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for justify as you used in previous passages

**Righteous** people live because of faith. Someone who is righteous is behaving in the right way. Only a righteous person can have a good relationship with God. When people trust in Jesus, God declares that those people are righteous. For more information on righteousness, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for righteous as you used in previous passages

**Faith** means to rely on someone, to trust and believe that what that person says is true. This specific faith is the way people believe in Jesus. For more information on faith, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for faith as you used in previous passages

**Christ** redeemed people from the curse of the law. Christ is a title for Jesus that reminds the believers that Jesus is the Messiah, or the Savior and king that God chose to come and rescue people. For more information on Christ, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Christ as you used in previous passages.

When you redeem a person, you free that person from debt or slavery. This could involve paying a person's debt. Christ did not pay anything to anyone for us. But Christ offered his own life in our place, like a person offers payment, to make us free from slavery to sin and evil. It is like Christ paid a very costly price for this: Christ's own life.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **redeem**. Look up redeem in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Christ redeemed us so that the Gentiles would share Abraham's **blessing** from God. A blessing is the way that God blesses a person or does something good for that person. For more information on blessing, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for blessing as you used in previous passages.

The word **Gentile** refers to all people who are not Jews. For more information on Gentile, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Gentile as you used in previous passages.

Believers also receive the **Spirit**. The Spirit or the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit makes it possible for people to become followers of Jesus. When people start to follow Jesus, the Holy Spirit works in those people's lives to help them to behave more and more like Jesus, to make them more and more holy. For more information on Spirit, refer to Holy Spirit in the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Spirit as you used in previous passages.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 3:15–18 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In the last section, Paul explained that Christ took on the curse or punishment that the law gave to people. Paul has been talking about agreements that God made with Abraham and the Jewish people, who are the Israelites. In this passage, Paul explains that just like when people make serious agreements, God does not change or cancel God's agreements. Instead, God fulfills or completes God's agreements, just like God said he would. So when God made the law agreement, God did not change God's agreement or promise with Abraham.

God made a covenant or very serious promise to Abraham. God also made a covenant with the Jewish people when God gave the law to the Jewish people. Paul compares those two covenants with the way that people make covenants. The Galatians know how people make very serious agreements or promises. First, at least two people or groups decide on something. Then those two groups make that decision official. If the people speak the agreement aloud, the people might shake hands to show this. But if the people write down the agreement, sometimes the people might sign their names on the paper. Once the people do this, the people cannot change or cancel the agreement. The people who agree must do what they say they will do.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think of some serious agreements or promises that you make in your culture. How do you show that these agreements are serious? How do you show that you certainly will do what you said you would do? Pause this audio here.

Paul compares the way that people make covenants or agreements with the way God makes promises. In the same way, no one can change God's covenant promises. God also does not change or cancel his agreement. God does what God says he is going to do.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what do people believe about the way that God or gods make agreements with people? How are these agreements the same or different from the agreements that people make? Pause this audio here.

Paul then talks about the promise that God made to Abraham and Abraham's seed. When people talk about a man's seed, they are talking about a man's descendants. This can mean one descendant, or a group of people who are this man's descendants. God promised to bless all people through Abraham. Paul says that the promise God made was about one of Abraham's descendants in particular, specifically Christ. Christ is Abraham's descendant and the one who blessed all people.

God made this covenant with Abraham long before God gave the law to the Israelites. This means that God asked people to believe in him before God asked people to obey the law. God's covenant with Abraham was a gracious promise that did not depend on what Abraham did.

The inheritance that God promised to Abraham does not depend on the law or the way that people obey the law. Normally, an inheritance is something that people receive from a person after that person dies. In the Bible, people sometimes use inheritance to mean the way God blesses people as God promised. God blessed Abraham when God said Abraham was righteous and gave Abraham a good relationship with God.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when you or someone you know received an inheritance from someone else. What did you have to do to earn that inheritance? How did people know that the inheritance belonged to you? Could anyone stop you from receiving that inheritance? Pause this audio here.

The way God blessed Abraham shows that people receive an inheritance or blessing from God, not because they obey the law, but because of God's kindness. Now, God blesses people when he justifies those people because they have faith in Jesus. When God does this, God fulfills his promise to bless people through Jesus, Abraham's special descendant.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 3:15–18 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul compares the way people make covenants with the way God makes covenants.

**In the second part:** Paul shows how the covenant God made with Abraham and Abraham's seed is about Christ.

**In the third part:** Paul says that God always keeps God's covenants, so the law covenant does not cancel the covenant God made with Abraham.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* God
* Abraham
* And Abraham's seed, who is Christ

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

To begin the first part, Paul calls the believers brothers to show that Paul still loves the Galatian believers, even though Paul has rebuked the believers. Paul says that Paul will take an example from daily life or an example that the believers would know because they often see this example. Once people have made a covenant or solemn agreement, those people establish or make that covenant official. Then the people cannot add other words or make more requirements. No one can cancel or decide that they do not want to do what they said they would do. God follows the same rules for the agreements God makes with his people.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, what words or phrases do you have for a very solemn agreement that people make? What words or phrases do you have for agreements between God and people? Discuss how you want to translate the way that Paul compares these agreements. Pause this audio here.

Then in the second part, Paul explains how God fulfilled the agreement God gave to Abraham. Paul says God made "promises" to Abraham because God repeated his promise to Abraham several times. And this was a special sort of promise because God promised to do all the work. Abraham does not have to do anything to receive God's promise. God made this promise to Abraham and Abraham's seed or offspring. In the original language, offspring or seed could mean one or many descendants. God did promise to bless Abraham's descendants, and God did give those descendants an inheritance. This inheritance was the land where Abraham's descendants lived. Paul would know this, but Paul is emphasizing that this promise also looks forward to one specific descendant, Christ. God fulfilled the promise to bless all people through Abraham's family because of what Christ did.

Stop here and discuss how you want to translate "Abraham's seed." In your language, how do you refer to a person's descendants? What words do you have that could refer to one or more people? Think about the word you use to refer to a family in your language. How many people does this word refer to? If you do not have a word that refers to one or more people, discuss as if you want to translate "seed" with a word that means "one descendant" or "many descendants." Pause this audio here.

In the third part, Paul talks about how the law covenant that God later gave to Moses and the Israelites does not cancel God's promise to Abraham. God established his promise or covenant with Abraham, which means God made it official to show that God would surely do what God said he would do. God then gave the law agreement to the Jewish people 430 years after God made the solemn promise to Abraham. Paul explains that God did not cancel God's promises with the law agreement. When God said he would bless Abraham, God did not change his mind and say that Abraham's descendants now have to obey the law to earn this blessing.

To show this, Paul talks about the inheritance God gives to people. In the Old Testament, the people used the word inheritance to talk about the way that the Jews received the land God promised to give them. Paul uses this word here to refer to the way God blesses people when God gives those people a right relationship with God because those people trust in Jesus. God's people receive this inheritance or blessing as a result of God's promise to bless them through Jesus, the special descendant of Abraham.

Stop here and discuss how you want to translate inheritance, or the way God blesses people. In your language, what words do you have for a good thing that someone gives to another person? Pause this audio here.

When Paul talks about the way God blesses people, Paul states the opposite of what is true. If God did give the inheritance to people because they obeyed the law, then this would be different than the way God promised it. God would be breaking the promise.

But, just like Paul said earlier, God does not break or change agreements. Instead, God kindly gave Abraham the inheritance, a right relationship with God, because God promised to bless Abraham. In the same way, God does not bless people because they obey the law. God blesses people because God promised to do it.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "My brothers and sisters, here is an example to explain what I mean. After two people make an official agreement, no one else can cancel that agreement or change it. In the same way, God made promises to Abraham and Abraham's descendant. God did not say, 'and to your descendants.' That would mean many people. But God said, 'and to your descendant.' That means only one person; that person is Christ."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I know the Galatians may be upset or embarrassed when I correct or teach them. I want to assure the Galatians that I still care about them. I say these things because I want the Galatians to understand the truth! or
* I know this can be confusing, so I will compare this idea to something the Galatians know and understand; or
* God has always planned to send Jesus to save people. We can see how God was helping people look forward to Jesus. We can trust that God has always had a good way to give people a good relationship with God.

Continue the drama.

Then Paul says, "Here is what I want you to understand: God made a covenant with Abraham and promised to keep it. Then, 430 years later, God gave the law to the people. The law does not cancel the covenant that God had already made. The law did not cause God to break his promise."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing God, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am consistent, and I do what I say I will do. I have never broken a promise and I never will; or
* I want my people to look at what I have done in the past so that my people can trust that I will continue to act in the same way; or
* I love to bless people in many ways. I did bless the Jewish people as they waited for the promised Savior. And now I bless the Jewish people and all people through Christ.

Continue the drama.

Paul says, "If we receive what God gives because we obey the law, then we do not receive it because God promised it to us, but because of what we did. But God kindly gave the inheritance to Abraham because God promised to bless Abraham."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing the Galatian believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* Though Paul is teaching us many things, I can understand what Paul is saying when Paul compares it to examples that we know; or
* I am thankful that God gives us a good relationship with him because of how kind God is; or
* I had not realized that because of the way I was thinking about the law agreement, I was acting like God did not bless people like God said he would. That was a disrespectful way of thinking!

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 3:15–18 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul calls the Galatians **brothers**. Paul frequently uses the word for brother when Paul refers to a fellow believer. Paul does this to show how Paul cares for that believer. When there is more than one brother, the word can also mean brothers and sisters. For more information on brothers, refer to believer in the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for brothers as you used in previous passages.

People cannot change or cancel a covenant after they formally agree to the covenant. When people make a covenant, they make a solemn promise to each other that they cannot break. God made several covenants with people. Sometimes, God makes a covenant and says he will surely do something, like the covenant God makes with Abraham. Sometimes, God makes a covenant and says he will do something if the people promise to do something God asks them to. This is the kind of agreement that God made with the Jewish people when God gave them the law.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **covenant**. Look up covenant in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

God makes a promise to Abraham. This promise is the covenant God makes with Abraham, but this word for promise is different than the word for covenant.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **promise**. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

God made a promise to Abraham and Abraham's seed or offspring. In a plant, a seed is the small part of a plant from which a new plant can grow. With humans, the seed of a man is another way to talk about a man's descendants. A person's descendants are his children, grandchildren, and all future generations from the same family line. When you talk about the seed of a man, you can be talking about one person, or about a group of people who are this person's descendants.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **seed**. Look up seed in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul refers to the story in the **Scriptures** where God gave this promise to Abraham. When people in the New Testament talk about the Scripture, or the Scriptures, they are talking about the part of the Bible that believers now call the Old Testament. For more information on Scriptures, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Scripture as you used in previous passages.

Abraham's seed is **Christ**. Christ is a title for Jesus that reminds the believers that Jesus is the Messiah, or the Savior and king that God chose to come and rescue people. For more information on Christ, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Christ as you used in previous passages.

God gave the **law** to the Jewish people 430 years after God gave Abraham the promise. The law is the set of instructions that God gave the people of Israel. For more information on law, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for law as you used in previous passages.

God does not give people an inheritance because of the way those people obey the law. Normally, an inheritance is property or wealth that an heir receives after someone else dies. In the Bible, people use inheritance to mean the way God blesses people as God promised. The Jewish people's inheritance was the land God promised to give them. Paul uses this word here to refer to the way God blesses people when God gives those people a right relationship with God.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **inheritance**. Look up inheritance in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Because of his **grace**, God gives the inheritance to Abraham as a promise. God gives people grace when God is kind to people, even though those people do not deserve it. For more information on grace, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for grace as you used in previous passages.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 3:19–25 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In the previous section, Paul showed that God blessed Abraham because of God's promise, not because Abraham obeyed the law. Now, in this section, Paul explains why God gave the law to people. The law showed people what sin was. But when Christ came, the law would no longer apply to people. Paul compares the law to several familiar roles to help the Galatians understand this.

Since Paul has been talking about what the law does not do, Paul knows people will wonder what God did give the law for. Paul explains in this passage that God added the law to his promise to show people what sin is. People were already acting in a bad or evil way, but now that God told them God's laws, the people would know that they were breaking God's law. People could know exactly what was the right way to live and what was the wrong way to live.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Imagine you were playing a new game and no one told you the rules to play the game. If you play in the wrong way because you do not know the rules, how does this affect the game? How is this different from if you know the right rules and choose not to obey them? Pause this audio here.

This law only applied to people for a certain amount of time. This would surprise the Jews, who thought that people would have to obey the law forever. But when Abraham's Seed or special descendant came, then the law agreement no longer applied. Remember that in the last passage, Paul explained that this Seed is Christ.

Paul then explains that the law was less important or lower in status than the promise God made to Abraham. While God gave the law to people, God did not speak directly to the people about the law. God gave the law to angels, who gave the law to Moses. Then Moses gave the law to the people. Angels are supernatural, spiritual beings that God created. Angels give messages from God to people. Sometimes, angels speak with so much authority that it is as if God himself is speaking. In the Old Testament, the storyteller who tells the story of how God gave the law to the people does not mention the angels. The storyteller there just emphasizes how the law came from God himself.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when an angel communicated with you or with someone you know. Why did the angel communicate with you or that person? Pause this audio here.

Moses was a mediator, someone who helped two people or groups of people make an agreement. In this law agreement, both the Jewish people and God agreed to do certain things. If the Jewish people obeyed God's law, God would bless the people. But God did not use a mediator when God gave his promise to Abraham. God alone made a promise. And God made that promise directly to Abraham. This shows that the promise is more important than the law.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do you make important agreements in your culture? How do you show that these agreements are very important? Now think of some less important agreements. What are some different ways you can make these agreements? How do you know that these agreements are not as important as the first kind of agreement? Pause this audio here.

Though the law is different from the promise, Paul emphasizes that the law does not contradict or disagree with God's promise to Abraham. Both the law and God's promise are a part of God's plan, but God uses the law and the promise for different reasons. The Jews said that when people obey the law, people receive the full spiritual life that Paul talked about in the last section. This is the life where people have a good relationship with God. But Paul says this is not what the law does. God gives people life and righteousness through fulfilling God's promise, not through the law or the way people obey. If the law gave people life, then it would be like God answered the question of "How can we have life?" with two different answers!

Instead, the law's purpose is to show that when someone sins, that person is guilty of breaking God's law. Paul talks about the Scriptures, where people wrote down the law, like it is a judge who judges people. As a punishment because they acted in a bad way, the judge sends those people to prison. Paul then talks about sin as if it were a jailer who has control over prisoners. Just like prisoners do what the jailer says, all human beings do what sin tells them to do. Sin controls people.

Paul explains with this comparison that the law shows people how they disobey God, so they can know they need Christ. God promised to Abraham that God would bless people and make them righteous. When people heard the law, people saw how they sinned and needed God to make them righteous. God fulfilled his promise through what Jesus Christ did. God gives the blessing of life and righteousness to people who have faith in Jesus Christ.

Paul next compares the law to a guard who guards people in prison. The law was there to restrict people from a sinful way of life until Christ came. Then God revealed how we could trust or have faith in Christ. When God did that, the law's time as a guard was finished. Next, Paul compares the law to a guardian. A guardian was a slave whom a Greek or Roman man would assign to supervise the man's child, both inside and outside the home. The slave made sure the child did what the child was supposed to, like go to school and follow the rules the master had for his children. Guardians were often strict and could punish the child to correct the child. The guardian would take care of the child until the child turned 19 and became an adult. In the same way, the law was in charge of people who followed God only for a certain amount of time, until Christ came.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what kind of people would you hire or put in charge of your children? When does a child become an adult and no longer need someone to take care of them? Pause this audio here.

Notice how Paul compares the law to jobs that only last for a certain amount of time. The judge and jailor only judge and guard a person until the person's punishment is done. The guardian only takes care of the child until the child grows up. In the same way, the law has finished its job and is no longer in charge of people. Christ has come, and God now justifies people because of the way people have faith in Christ.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 3:19–25 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul explains that the law shows people what sin is. So the law is less important than the promise God made to Abraham.

**In the second part:** Paul shows that the law does not conflict with the promise. Paul compares the law to a judge to show how the law works.

**In the third part:** Paul compares the law to a prison guard and a guardian to show that the law was only in charge of people until Christ came.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* Jesus Christ, who is Abraham's seed
* Angels
* Moses, the mediator
* And God

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

To begin the first part, Paul asks a question that Paul does not expect anyone to answer. Paul asks why God gave the law at all. Paul is answering a question that the Galatians may wonder or ask about. Paul says that God added the law to the promise because of transgressions. A transgression is the way that people choose to break a law. If there is no law, people cannot break the law, though they still act in a bad way. But now, when people know God's law and then act in a bad way, those people definitely know that they are disobeying God.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: A transgression is very similar to a sin, but the transgression focuses on the way that people break a law. In your language, what word do you have for the way that people break a law? Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: As an activity, pretend you are a teacher and are about to teach a short lesson to the others in the group about something they do not know. Think about some questions people may have about this topic. Then tell the people in the group about this topic and give the answers to the questions that you thought the others might have. How do you show that you are answering questions you think the others might ask? Pause this audio here.

These laws would apply to people until the Seed, who is Jesus, had come. God made a promise to Abraham and Abraham's Seed, and this promise was about the Seed. So some translations say that God's promise was to the Seed, and some translations say that God promised about the Seed.

Paul explains that God gave the law through angels and Moses, a mediator, but that God gave his promise to Abraham directly. A mediator is someone who helps the two groups make an agreement with one another. When God gave the law agreement, God used a mediator, Moses. But God is one. The phrase "God is one" is a truth that people would repeat about God. When Paul says that God is one, Paul means that God acted directly, without a person as a go\-between. God did not need a mediator since only God made the promise. Paul does not say he is talking about the promise to Abraham here, but we can see how Paul is comparing the law God gave to Moses and the promise God gave to Abraham in this passage.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when two people were trying to make an agreement, and a third person who was not a part of the agreement helped the other two. In your language, what words or phrases do you have for a person who helps other people make an agreement? Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How would you talk about an agreement that did not need a third person to help the other two? Discuss how you will translate the way Paul says "God is one." You could translate Paul's meaning and say something like, "God acted directly," or "God acted as one person without a go\-between." Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul asks another question that Paul does not expect anyone to answer. Paul uses the question to correct what people may think when they hear what Paul is saying. Paul is emphasizing that the law is certainly not opposed to or opposite to the promises of God. Again, Paul says "more than one promise" to refer to the one promise that God repeated several times to Abraham.

The law would conflict with the promise if the law did what the Jewish people thought it did. To talk about this, Paul says the opposite of what is true. If the law gave life to people, this would not be the way God said he would cause people to be righteous and have life. Since Paul has already explained that God does not give people righteousness because they follow the law, Paul means that there is no law anywhere that can give life to people.

While the purpose of the law is different from the purpose of the promise, Paul shows that the law causes people to need or look forward to the promise. Paul talks about the Scriptures, which include the law, as if the Scriptures were a judge. These Scriptures and the law showed that people are guilty, so that people would understand that sin controls people. Then people would see how much they need what God promised. People receive the promise by, or because they believe in, Jesus Christ. And God gives the promise to people who believe. Paul repeats that God gives this promise to people who have faith or believe in Christ to emphasize how important this is. People's faith is more important than the way people obey the law.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In this passage, Paul talks about different people and the way they carry out a law: a transgressor or person who breaks a law, a judge who punishes a person who breaks a law, and a jailor or guard who imprisons a lawbreaker. Tell a story about a time when someone broke a law and received a punishment. What kinds of people were involved in this process? Discuss what words or phrases you have in your language for the official people who order a punishment and then carry out the punishment. Pause this audio here.

In the third part, Paul talks about how the law was in charge of people before the coming of faith. The coming of faith means the way Christ came and made it possible for people to have faith in Christ. So Paul is referring to the time before God justified people because those people believed in Christ. Paul says the law was in charge of people like a guard who keeps people in prison. The law was in charge of people until God showed people that they must believe in Christ.

Paul also compares the law to a guardian, or a slave that a master would put in charge of the master's child. Just like a guardian controlled a child for a period of time, the law controlled people until Christ came. Paul is clear that people can now have faith in Christ, so we do not need the law as a guardian anymore.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will translate the idea of a guardian. While this slave did guide the child to school and help the child with customs and schoolwork, the slave was not a teacher, so teacher is not a good word here. Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* Jesus Christ, who is Abraham's seed
* Angels
* Moses, the mediator
* And God

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "So then, you may wonder why God gave the law. God gave the law to show us what sin is. God wanted people to obey the law until the special descendant of Abraham came. This was Christ, to whom God made a promise. God gave the law to his people through angels and Moses, a mediator who works with two groups of people. But God, who is one, did not use a mediator when God gave his promise to Abraham."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I do not want people to think that God gave the law for no reason. God always has a good plan, and I want people to remember that. Then it will be easier to trust God; or
* I know this will be surprising and confusing to people. I wish I were there to answer all the people's questions! I will try to think of what people may wonder about and then answer their big questions as I explain.

Continue the drama.

Paul says, "Some people may then think that God's law and God's promises do not agree. But this is not at all true! I say this because if God had given the law to cause people to live forever, then people could become righteous because they obeyed the law. But the law cannot give life. Instead, the Scriptures, like a judge, declare that the desire to sin has power over everyone. This happened so that God might give the blessing that God promised to those who have faith in Jesus Christ. God gives this promise to those who believe."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing God, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I do not say things that do not agree or try to trick people. I had a good plan when I gave both the law agreement and the promise; or
* I want people to understand how much they need life from me. I am glad to give life to people and will give it to anyone who has faith!

Continue the drama.

Then Paul says, "Before the time arrived when people could believe in Christ, the law was like a guard who held us in prison. The law kept us in prison until God showed us that we must believe in Christ. Let me use another example: The law was like a person who watches a child. The law was in charge of us until Christ came, so that, when Christ came, God would make us right because of our faith. Christ has come, and people believe in Christ for God to justify them. That means that the law is finished controlling us."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Galatians, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am embarrassed that I have been following the law when that way of living is finished. It was like I was acting like a child again or going back to prison when I did not need to! or
* I am surprised when Paul says that the law would not apply to us forever! This is very different than what my people teach; or
* I am thankful that Paul is comparing the law to things that we understand and see often. This helps me understand.

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 3:19–25 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul talks about the **law** in this passage. This law is the set of instructions that God has given the people of Israel. Paul also says that there is no kind of law anywhere that can give people righteousness and life. For more information on law, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for law as you used in previous passages.

God gave the law to show people what transgressions were. A transgression is the way that people break a law.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **transgression**. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

The law would continue only until the **Seed** came. With humans, the seed of a man is another way to talk about a man's descendants. When you talk about the seed of a man, you can be talking about one person, or about a group of people who are this person's descendants. This seed is Jesus. For more information on seed, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for seed as you used in previous passages.

God's promise referred to the seed. Use the same word or phrase for promise as you used in previous passages.

God gave the law to the people through **angels** and Moses. An angel is a supernatural, spiritual being that God created. Angels give messages from God to people. Some angels speak with so much authority that it is as if God himself is speaking. For more information on angel, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for angel as you used in previous passages.

Paul calls Moses a mediator. A mediator is a person who helps two or more people or groups make an agreement.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **mediator**. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

The law certainly does not give **righteousness**. Someone who is righteous is behaving in the right way. When people trust in Jesus, God declares that those people are righteous. For more information on righteousness, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for righteous as you used in previous passages

Paul compares **Scripture** to a judge. When people in the New Testament talk about the Scripture, or the Scriptures, they are talking about the part of the Bible that believers now call the Old Testament. This includes the law that God gave to Moses for God's people. For more information on Scriptures, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Scripture as you used in previous passages.

The desire to **sin** has power over everyone. Sin is an act of rebellion against God. God has made good laws, and if people follow these laws, then people will be able to live together in peace. But people constantly break God's laws, and when people do, they sin. For more information on sin, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for sin as you used in previous passages.

God gives what he promised to people when those people have **faith** in Jesus Christ. Faith means to rely on someone, to trust and believe that what that person says is true. For more information on faith, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for faith as you used in previous passages

**Christ** is a title for Jesus that reminds believers that Jesus is the Messiah, or the Savior. For more information on Christ, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Christ as you used in previous passages.

When Christ came, God **justified** people because of their faith. When God justifies a person, that means the person is righteous and has a right relationship with God. For more information on justify, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for justify as you used in previous passages

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 3:26–4:7 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

Paul just said in the last passage that because we can now trust in Christ, the law no longer controls the believers. This is because the believers are now God's children, as Paul reminds the Galatians in this passage. All of God's children are united and equal, no matter who they are. Paul compares the way people lived with the law to slaves and children who are not ready to inherit. But Christ came and freed people from slavery. Those people are now God's children, not slaves to the law. So believers no longer need to obey the law in order for God to justify the believers.

Remember that in the last passage, Paul said that the law controls the believers like a guardian controls a child. Now Paul says that believers are God's children without a guardian. God has made us his children because of our faith in Christ. People experience baptism to show this. When someone dips a believer in water, this is a sign that the believer has entered into a new relationship. That person is now united with Christ. The believers start to act and be like Christ. Like Christ is God's son, the believer is now God's child. Paul compares the way believers are united and become like Christ to the way that people put on clothes. People put on certain clothes to show who they are. People would often change their clothes to show how they have changed on the inside. Paul compares these people to the believers. Both these people and the believers have put on or gained something and changed in some way.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, when are some times when people would change their clothes to show how they have changed on the inside? Think about when a child becomes an adult or a person marries someone else. What kinds of clothes do these people wear before and after that change? Pause this audio here.

Remember that the Galatian believers had divided the believers into groups of Jews and Gentiles, and said that the Jews were better or more important. In this time, people constantly divided people into different groups and said that one was better than the other. Sometimes, people would even stop some of these groups, like women or slaves, from participating in certain religious celebrations or places.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what are some of the common ways that people divide people into groups? What are some groups in your area that people think are not important or even bad? Pause this audio here.

Paul says that among the believers, no group is better than another group! All believers are equal and united because they believe in Jesus Christ. There is no difference between people because of their people group, their social position, or their gender. None of these things stop people from becoming children of God. This is because everyone is one, or united in Christ Jesus because they have the same faith in Christ.

Christ is Abraham's descendant, so if believers belong to Christ and are united with Christ, then believers are also Abraham's descendants. Because believers are Abraham's descendants, believers are Abraham's heirs or people who receive an inheritance. Believers receive or inherit the same promise that God made to Abraham. This promise is that God justifies people because of their faith.

To explain, Paul compares this to the way that an heir normally receives an inheritance. A man's heir was usually his son, who would eventually receive his father's possessions. Usually, this happened after a father died. Here, Paul may mean a situation where the father has decided to give some of his possessions to his son when the son becomes an adult. The father will do this even if the father is still alive when his son becomes an adult. When the heir is a child, the child does not have many more rights than a slave. The heir certainly will own his father's property someday, but for now, others make decisions for the heir, just like a master does for a slave. The father has chosen people to look after the son and the property while the son is young. These people have the authority to give the son orders as long as the father says it is necessary.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, how does a father give his possessions to his children, either during the father's life or after he dies? When does the father give his possessions to his children? Who helps take care of the young children and the father's possessions until the child is an adult? Pause this audio here.

In the same way that an heir is like a slave when he is a child, Jewish and Gentile believers were like slaves before they heard about Jesus. Paul says basic powers or forces controlled the Galatians like a master controls a slave. This can mean the law, which Paul just said had control over people, as well as other rules and customs. This can also mean the evil powers or spirits that people worship like gods.

God the Father decided the right time to send his Son, Jesus, to save people from those things that controlled people. When Jesus came, Jesus was born as a human and had to obey the law like other humans. Jesus did this to redeem people, like a person would redeem or pay a price to free a slave or a prisoner. When God's Son Jesus had redeemed the believers, the believers became God's children. God adopted the believers and gave them the status of sons with all of a son's privileges.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, how do you adopt a child? When you adopt a child, how do you treat this child? Pause this audio here.

Because believers are God's children, God sent the Spirit of his Son, or the Holy Spirit, to be with the believers. The Spirit teaches people how to pray like Jesus, who called God "Abba." In the original language, the word "Abba" means father or papa. This was a very personal and close name for a father. Before Jesus came, people did not call God Abba. Now, since believers are God's children too, believers can call God "Abba" or father.

So believers are God's children and no longer under the control of law or anything else. Believers are children because of God, not because of what the believers did. Since God made the believers God's children, God will certainly do what he has promised for his children.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 3:26–4:7 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** All believers are God's children, heirs, and united with Christ, no matter what group of people the believer belongs to.

**In the second part:** Paul compares the way an heir is like a slave when he is a child to the way the believers were like slaves to, or under the control of, the law.

**In the third part:** Paul tells the story of how God sent Jesus to redeem believers from slavery. Now believers are sons and heirs.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The believers, who are Galatians, Jewish or Gentile, men or women, free people or slaves
* God the Father
* Christ Jesus, God's Son
* Abraham
* Heirs who are not adults
* Guardians and trustees
* Fathers of the heirs
* Basic forces or powers
* The woman to whom God's son was born, or Jesus's mother
* And the Spirit of God's son, or the Holy Spirit

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Throughout this passage, Paul talks about things that are true for all believers, so Paul will often talk about what "we" do or what God does for "us." Sometimes, Paul also wants the Galatians to understand and focus on certain things, so Paul talks directly to the Galatians. Paul says "you" to show how the things Paul says also apply to Galatians specifically. The Galatians are confused about what makes a person a real believer. So Paul reminds the Galatians about what is true for all believers.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: As an activity, teach someone else in the group to do a simple task, like how to make a certain food. As you teach, show that you and other people do this task in this way. How would you show the listener that they also should do the task like this? How do you show the listener that they should focus on certain parts of your instructions? Discuss how you want to translate the way Paul talks about believers generally and how Paul talks to the Galatian believers specifically. Pause this audio here.

Throughout this passage, Paul talks about the way that children inherit. In this time, a man would eventually give most of his possessions to his sons, especially the man's oldest son. This son would have the most rights and privileges of the man's children. Paul may use the word "son" throughout this passage to show that all the believers have the privileges and rights of a son. People would often use the male version of a word, like sons, to refer to both men and women, or girls and boys. So the Galatians would know that Paul is talking about the believers who are women, too. Also, Paul contrasts young heirs with the way that believers are now—God's adult sons and daughters who no longer need a guardian.

Stop here and discuss how you want to translate "sons" or "children." In your language, what words do you have to refer to someone's sons and daughters who have grown up? Pause this audio here.

In the first part, Paul says that the Galatian believers are all united because of certain things. The believers all have faith in Jesus, so God makes them all his children. The believers are all united with Christ, which the believers show through baptism. When believers experience baptism, they show that they now belong to Jesus and want to follow Jesus and act like Jesus. Paul compares the way that believers become like Christ to the way that people put on new clothes. Everyone can see that the believers are now God's children, because the believers begin to act like Christ.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do you talk about the way that a person is completely different because that person acts like someone else? Discuss how you want to translate the way the believers put on Christ, like a person puts on new clothes. Pause this audio here.

But people are not just different on the outside. People are completely different inside. The old differences between people that were important in the old way of living are no longer important. Of course, these differences still exist. Jewish people do not become Gentiles, and women do not become men. But these differences do not affect the way that God redeems and justifies people. Instead, all believers are equal and united because they believe in Jesus Christ. Each believer is Abraham's seed or descendant and becomes an heir. Believers inherit or receive a blessing, just like God promised to Abraham's descendants.

In the second part, Paul talks about what life was like before people believed in Jesus. To begin, Paul uses an expression that means Paul will explain further. Paul compares how people lived when the law controlled them to an heir who is still a child. Paul says that this heir is no different than a slave. Paul is exaggerating to make his point. A boy who will inherit possessions is very different from a slave. The boy is part of the family and will receive property, unlike the slave. But someone controls or has power over both the boy and the slave. While the boy is a child, the boy does not control the property that will one day belong to the boy. Guardians and trustees take care of the boy and make decisions about the property, which will later belong to him. These people do this until the time when the father decides the boy is ready to inherit.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, when are some acceptable times to exaggerate or say something very strongly to make a point? Pause this audio here.

In the same way that an heir is like a slave when he is a child, people were slaves. Paul says, "We were slaves," to talk about how all believers, both Jewish and Gentile, were slaves. Elemental forces or basic powers controlled the believers. This can mean the laws, rules, and customs of the world or the false gods and spirits that people used to worship. Either way, Paul is talking about the old things people used to live by and obey.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how would you refer to laws, spirits, false gods, or things that people obey instead of God? Discuss how you want to translate a group that could include any of those things. You could also mention just one of those things as an example, such as "the way we were slaves to things like the law." Pause this audio here.

In the third part, Paul reminds the Galatians about what God has done for the believers. Paul may have told this story in such a way that believers could repeat it to remind themselves of this true story. Paul says that God the Father decided the right time to send his Son. Paul calls Jesus God's Son to remind the believers of the special relationship between God the Father and Jesus. Now the believers also have a parent\-child relationship with God! Jesus was with God in heaven. God sent Jesus from heaven to earth. Paul says that Jesus was born of a woman. This is a phrase that means a person is human.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, what are some phrases you use to talk about the way that someone is human? Pause this audio here.

Jesus was also under the law, which means that Jesus had to obey the law, just like the people Jesus came to save had to obey the law. And Jesus saved the people under the law. This refers to both the Jews and the Gentiles, who all lived under certain laws. All of these people were like slaves to the law. Jesus redeemed these people, like a person pays money to free a slave. When God's Son had redeemed people, God adopted those people as God's sons or children.

Because the believers are sons, the Spirit of the Son, or the Holy Spirit, is with believers. Paul says, "because you are sons," to directly address the Galatians. Paul is emphasizing that the Galatians all have full legal status as sons, even if they are Gentiles. Paul then returns to say "our hearts" to focus on the fact that all believers are God's children and have the Spirit. The Spirit is in believers' hearts. People would use the word heart for the place where a person's thoughts, feelings, and decisions happen. The Spirit helps believers when they think, feel, and make decisions. The Spirit enables believers to cry out or pray earnestly and intensely. When believers pray, they can call God a close and affectionate name for father, which shows the close relationship believers have with God. Jesus, God's son, called God "Abba." Now, since believers are God's children too, believers can call God "Abba."

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, what is a personal and affectionate name that children call their father? Discuss here how you want to translate "Abba." Some translations keep the word in the original language and add their own word for father as well. Some translations just put their own word for father. Pause this audio here.

To conclude and emphasize the important things Paul has just said, Paul again talks directly to the Galatians. Paul reminds the Galatians that they are no longer slaves but sons and heirs, because of what God did. If believers went back to following the law, it would be like going back to being children and slaves again!

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Embodying the Text

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 3:26–4:7 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The believers, who are Galatians, Jewish or Gentile, men or women, free people or slaves
* God the Father
* Christ Jesus, God's Son
* Abraham
* Heirs who are not adults
* Guardians and trustees
* Fathers of the heirs
* Basic forces or powers
* The woman to whom God's son was born, or Jesus's mother
* And the Spirit of God's son, or the Holy Spirit

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "All of you who are united with Christ Jesus are children of God because you believe in Christ. You who received baptism are united with Christ, and you have become like Christ. You are all one in Christ Jesus, so it does not matter if a person is a Jew or a Gentile, a slave or a free person, a man or a woman. Now that you belong to Christ, you are Abraham's descendants and you receive the blessing that God promised to Abraham."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I rejoice that God has made me his child. I want the Galatians to feel that same joy, too! or
* It makes me sad to hear that the Galatians say one group is better than another. The Galatians do not see that we are all a part of the most important group: the people who belong to Christ!

Ask the person playing the Galatian believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* It is strange to hear Paul say that these differences between people groups or social standing do not matter. This is very different than the way I have learned; or
* I do remember how I experienced baptism. I remember that I wanted to show that I belonged to Jesus. I have seen the other believers experience baptism too, even though they were not the same as I was. But we have all experienced this together! I think I understand what Paul means.

Continue the drama.

Then Paul says, "Let me explain further. When the son who will receive his father's possessions is very young, someone else has authority over the son, like someone has authority over a slave. The son will one day own his father's property, but the son does not yet have authority over anything. The son must obey those who care for him and the property until the time comes when the son will become the owner. The son's father decides when that will be. It was the same with us before Christ came. We were like children, and we were like slaves to the powers of this world."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing the heir who is still a child, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* It is very hard to wait and listen to all these guardians and trustees! I want to be an adult and make my own decisions; or
* I am very small and I have to learn so much. I am glad that my father made a good plan to help me as I grow; or
* I am honored that my father will one day give me such wonderful possessions. I can see how my father cares for me.

Ask the person playing the father of the heir, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I know my child is not ready yet to manage so many things. I will choose people to provide for my son and protect him until he is ready; or
* I know what my child is like. I know the best time for the child to inherit; or
* I love my child and want to give my child good things.

Continue the drama.

Paul says, "But when the right time came, God sent his Son to earth. God's Son was born a human being and had to obey the Law. God sent him to free us who were slaves to the law in order that God might make us his children. And because you are God's children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son, the Holy Spirit, to live in us. It is the Spirit who enables us to call out, 'Abba,' or 'Father.' Therefore, you are no longer a slave but rather a child. And since you are a child of God, God has made you his heir."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing God, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I love people and want to rescue them. I do not want people to live as slaves; or
* I want to give my people good things, just like a father gives good things to his children; or
* I want believers to have a good, close relationship with me. I want believers to talk to me and understand how much I care for them.

Ask the person playing Jesus, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I also love people and want them to be a part of my family; or
* Even though living as a human was not as nice as being with God the Father in heaven, I gladly chose to do this. I am even glad to die in a horrible way, because I want to save people and cause people to be a part of God's family; or
* God the Father, the Holy Spirit, and I work together in a wonderful way to show love to the believers.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 3:26–4:7 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Everyone who is united with **Christ** is a child of God. Christ is a title for Jesus that reminds believers that Jesus is the Savior. For more information on Christ, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Christ as you used in previous passages.

When people begin to trust in Jesus, God adopts them as children. Therefore, the people sometimes use the phrase "sons or children of God" to describe the people who trust and follow Jesus.

God adopts people because of their **faith**. This specific faith is the way people believe in Jesus. For more information on faith, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for faith as you used in previous passages

Believers who experience baptism are united with Christ. People took baptism, or washed in water, to show that they had repented or turned away from their sins and turned to God through believing in Jesus. When people take baptism, those people show that they now belong to Jesus and want to follow Jesus.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **baptism**. Look up baptism in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

**Jews** and **Gentiles** are both equal believers and united with Christ. The word Jews refers to the people who descend from Jacob. The word Gentile refers to all people who were not Jews. In the original language, Paul uses the word Greek to mean Gentiles. For more information on Jews and Gentiles, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same words or phrases for Jews and Gentiles as you used in previous passages.

**Slaves** and free people are also equal believers and united with Christ. A slave is a person who does work for someone else. A slave does not receive payment for his work and does not have the freedom to leave his master when he wants. For more information on slave, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for slave as you used in previous passages

If people belong to Christ, they are Abraham's **seed**. The seed of a man is another way to talk about a man's descendants. For more information on seed, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for seed as you used in previous passages.

Believers are also heirs. An heir is a person who inherits property or wealth after someone else dies. In this time, when a father died, that father's property went to his son. Believers are heirs of a promise. This means that what God had promised to Abraham was now also a promise for the believers.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **heir**. Look up heir in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Believers are heirs because of God's promise. Use the same word or phrase for promise as you used in previous passages.

Guardians and trustees look after an heir when the heir is still a child. These are people whom the father has chosen to look after his son while the son is young. These people have the authority to give the son orders. These people also take care of the property that the son will one day inherit. A guardian is a general term for someone who takes care of the child. Trustee is a more specific word for a person who takes care of the money or property.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **guardians** and **trustees**. If you have already translated these words in another book of the Bible, use the same words that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Basic powers or forces controlled the Galatians like a master controls a slave. This could mean the Jewish religious law or other rules and customs. This could also mean the evil powers or spirits that people worship like gods.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **basic powers** or **forces**. Look up law in the Master Glossary for more information. Even though basic powers refers to many kinds of things, look up evil spirits in the Master Glossary for more information about one of the kinds of powers Paul may be talking about. If you have already translated these words in another book of the Bible, use the same words that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

God sent his **Son** to live as a human. Jesus is called the Son of God because Jesus has a special relationship with God the Father. God and Jesus love each other in the way that a father and a son love each other. For more information on Son of God, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Son of God as you used in previous passages.

Jesus had to obey the **law**. This is the set of instructions that God has given the people of Israel. When Paul later talks about the people who are under the law, Paul refers to the way that people everywhere have to follow certain laws. For more information on law, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for law as you used in previous passages.

Jesus came to **redeem** people under the law. When you redeem a person, you free that person from debt or slavery. Jesus offered his own life in our place, like a person offers payment, to make us free from slavery to sin and evil. For more information on redeem, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for redeem as you used in previous passages.

God adopted the believers. When a person adopts a child, that person legally takes another person's child into their own family and takes care of that child as the person's own child. The adopted child has all the rights and privileges of the person's other children. The person loves the child as the person loves their other children.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **adopt**. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

God sends the **Spirit** of his Son to believers' hearts. This Spirit is the Holy Spirit. When people start to follow Jesus, the Holy Spirit works in those people's hearts to help them behave more and more like Jesus. For more information on Holy Spirit, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Spirit or Holy Spirit as you used in previous passages.

The heart is a muscle inside our body that keeps our blood flowing, but in the Bible, people use the word heart for the place where a person's thoughts, feelings, and decisions happen.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **heart**. Look up heart in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Because of the Spirit, believers can call God "Abba." Abba is the word for "father" in the language that the people in Israel spoke in Jesus's time. Jesus calls God "Abba" when Jesus prays to God before he dies. Because of the Holy Spirit, we can have the same relationship with God that a child has with its father, just like Jesus has.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **Abba**. Look up Abba in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 4:8–20 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

Paul has just explained that the Galatians are God's children. Now Paul shows how worried Paul is because of the way the Galatians are acting. Paul pleads with the Galatians not to return to their old way of life and slavery. Paul reminds the Galatians of the close relationship between Paul and the Galatians. Though the false teachers are the Galatians' real enemies, the Galatians are treating Paul like an enemy!

Paul repeats what Paul said at the end of the last passage: before the Galatians were God's children, the Galatians were slaves to so\-called gods. Though people worshiped these gods, these gods were not the true God and had no power to help the Galatians. But now the Galatians know the true God. This does not just mean that the Galatians know who God is. Paul means that the Galatians have a close relationship with God. And Paul clarifies that God really knows the believers, because God is the one who caused this close relationship.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, how do people interact or relate to gods or spirits? What kind of relationship or interaction do people believe they can have with a god or spirit? Pause this audio here.

Since the Galatians know what God has done for them, Paul is surprised that the Galatians begin to obey other forces or powers again. These forces are anything that people trust instead of God. These can be false gods, the law, or spirits that people believe control things like the stars and people's lives. Unlike God, these forces are weak and cannot save people. The forces are miserable or poor because they do not give people anything, but only cause people to be slaves again.

Paul now gives an example of the way the Galatians return to a bad way of living. The Galatians celebrate the special days and periods that the Jews celebrate. People would treat certain times as more sacred than others, both in the Jewish religion and in pagan religions. It is not bad to celebrate certain days and hold feasts. But the Galatians do this because the Galatians think it will bring them into a good relationship with God, which is wrong. Paul is worried about the Galatians because of the way the Galatians are thinking and acting. Though Paul has done much to help the Galatians, it is as if Paul's work has not really changed anything for the Galatians!

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what are some different sacred times or celebrations that you have? Why do people celebrate these? What do people believe that gods or spirits will do for people if people celebrate these events? Pause this audio here.

Next, Paul begs the Galatians to follow Paul's example. Paul no longer obeys the law in order to earn a good relationship with God. Though Paul is a part of the Jewish people group, Paul acts like a Gentile because Paul does not obey the law. The Galatians have not hurt or treated Paul unkindly in the past, so Paul asks the Galatians not to treat Paul unkindly now and ignore Paul!

To remind the Galatians of the good relationship that the Galatians have with Paul, Paul tells the story of the first time Paul came to Galatia. Originally, Paul may have planned to go to another place, but then Paul became sick and had to stop in Galatia. Galatia was a good area for someone who was sick to rest and heal. It is not clear what sickness Paul had, but Paul reminds the Galatians that Paul's sickness made things difficult for the Galatians, too. It is hard to take care of sick people, especially sick people you do not know! But the Galatians did take care of Paul. Also, in that time, people sometimes thought that gods caused people to be sick as a punishment. But the Galatians did not reject Paul or treat Paul like he was weak and worthless. Instead, the Galatians welcomed Paul and treated Paul kindly. In fact, the Galatians gave Paul the same kind of honor and respect that the Galatians would have given to important visitors, like an angel of God or even Jesus Christ! People would treat messengers with great respect, because messengers represented the people who sent them. At that time, the Galatians understood that Paul brought a message from Jesus, and the Galatians treated Paul respectfully.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What do people believe causes illnesses in your culture? How do you treat sick people in your culture? What kind of illnesses are uncomfortable to be around? Pause this audio here.

Paul can see a difference between the joyful and kind way the Galatians treated Paul in the past and the way the Galatians are acting and responding to Paul now. In the past, the Galatians would have done anything to help Paul. Paul says that the Galatians would have even taken out their own eyes to give to Paul if it would have helped Paul! Eyes are an important part of a person's body, and in that time, people often saw the eyes as a symbol of a person's most precious possessions. Now, however, the Galatians treat Paul differently. Because Paul continues to tell the Galatians the truth of the gospel, which does not include the law, the Galatians now act like Paul is an enemy or someone to be suspicious of!

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what do people consider to be their most valuable possessions or abilities? Tell a story about a person who was so devoted to someone else that the person gave up even their most valuable possessions to help that other person. Pause this audio here.

Paul says that the Galatians' real enemies are the false teachers. These teachers show great interest in and concern for the Galatians, but not to help the Galatians. These teachers actually try to cause division between the Galatians and Paul. Then the Galatians would not listen to Paul when Paul tells the truth about Christ! Instead, the Galatians would give all of their attention and respect to the false teachers.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, how do people treat teachers they respect? How do teachers try to gain respect and honor from people? Pause this audio here.

Paul says it is fine if other people show an interest in the Galatians, but these people's reasons must be good. And these people must constantly have good reasons and not just act in a kind way when Paul is there to see. These false teachers do not have good reasons for doing these things, and they do not really care about the Galatians.

To show how much Paul cares for the Galatians, Paul compares himself to a mother who loves and cares for her children. Paul compares the way Paul teaches and guides the Galatians to a woman who gives birth. When a woman gives birth, it is difficult and painful, but for a good reason. At the end, a woman has a child! In the same way, it is difficult and painful for Paul to lead the Galatians to follow Christ, but it is for a good reason. Paul feels pain for the Galatians until the Galatians begin to think and act like Christ himself. Since the Galatians are turning away from their faith, Paul has to lead the Galatians to the truth again, which is difficult and painful, like giving birth again!

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What are some actions in your culture that most people agree are very hard but bring a good thing or result? Tell a story about a time when a teacher worked very hard to help and care for their students. Which of those difficult tasks would you compare with how this teacher acted? Pause this audio here.

Paul says he wants to be with the Galatians so that Paul can help the Galatians. If Paul were with the Galatians, Paul could show the Galatians how much Paul cares and how the gospel is true. Then Paul would not have to use the severe language that Paul uses in this letter. Instead, Paul could speak gently to the Galatians again. Paul is so worried that he does not know what to do to help the Galatians!

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 4:8–20 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul says again that the Galatians are God's children, not slaves. So Paul is surprised that the Galatians want to return to their old way of living as slaves!

**In the second part:** Paul pleads with the Galatians to listen to Paul because of the close relationship the Galatians and Paul have with each other. The Galatians have treated Paul like a friend, so Paul wonders why the Galatians now treat Paul like an enemy.

**In the third part:** The false teachers are really the Galatians' enemy because the false teachers do not really care for the Galatians. Paul, however, cares very deeply for the Galatians, like a mother cares for her children.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* God
* The false gods
* Basic forces or powers
* An angel of God
* Christ Jesus
* And the false teachers

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Remember that to finish the last passage, Paul summed up what Paul had just said: that the believers were no longer slaves but sons. Because this is an important idea, Paul begins this passage in the same way. Paul reminds the Galatians again that before the Galatians knew God, or had a good relationship with God, the Galatians were slaves to false gods. Paul says these gods' nature or characteristics show that these gods are really not God. But now, the Galatians know God or have a relationship with God. To remind the Galatians that God started the relationship, Paul clarifies that God really knows the Galatians. Paul compares these forces or false gods with God to show how different they are. Paul has just talked about what God has done to free the believers. But these forces are weak and worthless. These forces have no power to save and have no value. These forces can be false gods, the law, or anything else people would worship and serve.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In the original language, this word for forces or powers is the same word from the last passage, when Paul talked about the way people used to be slaves to basic forces or powers. Review the word you used there and discuss whether you will use the same word here. Pause this audio here.

Paul then asks the Galatians why they would choose to return to these false gods and slavery. Paul does not expect the Galatians to answer this question. Paul asks this question to strongly rebuke the Galatians. The false teachers say that the law is part of the gospel. But Paul says that when the Galatians obey the law, it is the same as if the Galatians joined a different religion. This would be a shocking comparison! Not only that, but it would also be like the Galatians are choosing to be slaves again! Paul wants to show the Galatians that they are really acting in a foolish way!

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Paul asks questions to rebuke the Galatians. In your language, how would you rebuke someone? How would you show that the person is acting in a foolish way? Discuss how you want to translate Paul's question here. Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul reminds the Galatians of their good relationship with Paul. Paul does this to remind the Galatians that the Galatians can and do trust Paul. When Paul pleads with the Galatians to act in the same way as Paul does, it is because Paul cares for the Galatians. Paul calls the Galatians brothers and sisters to show Paul's affection for them, even though Paul rebukes the Galatians. Paul reminds the Galatians that they know what it was like when Paul first came to them. The Galatians accepted the truth, and they accepted Paul, even though Paul was sick. The Galatians could have treated Paul with scorn or treated Paul like Paul was worthless. The Galatians could have despised Paul or hated and rejected Paul. Instead, the Galatians received Paul or welcomed Paul into their homes. Paul compares the way the Galatians treated Paul to the way that Paul imagines the Galatians would treat an angel or even Christ. Paul means that the Galatians show Paul the highest honor and kindness.

Paul implies that when the Galatians first heard the gospel, the Galatians felt joy and blessing, or a good feeling, because they had a right relationship with God. Paul asks where the Galatians' joyful feelings are now. Paul asks the question to encourage the Galatians to think of how different their lives are now. Paul says strongly that Paul knows the Galatians used to feel differently. The Galatians used to have such deep love for Paul that the Galatians would do anything for Paul, even cut out their eyes to give to Paul!

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Here, Paul asks a question to urge the Galatians to think about something. In your language, how would you tell someone to think about something? Discuss how you want to translate Paul's question here. Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How would you talk about the way that someone is so devoted that they would do anything they could to help someone else? Pause this audio here.

Paul asks why the Galatians have changed. This time, Paul asks this question to show how Paul is disappointed and surprised that the Galatians would act in this way. When Paul first came to the Galatians, Paul told the Galatians the truth, and the Galatians treated Paul as a friend. But now, the Galatians reject Paul and the true things Paul taught. The Galatians act like Paul is their enemy who is trying to hurt the Galatians.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how would you show that you are disappointed in the way someone is acting? Discuss how you want to translate Paul's question here. Pause this audio here.

In the third part, Paul shows that the false teachers are the Galatians' enemy, not Paul. Paul talks about "those people," who we know are the people who teach the Galatians wrong teachings. These people are zealous or trying very hard to win over the Galatians, but not for a good reason. These teachers want to alienate or cause division between the Galatians and Paul, as well as the believers who believe the same as Paul. The false teachers only want the Galatians to have zeal or be passionate about the false teachers so that the Galatians will focus all their attention on the false teachers.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What words or phrases do you have for the way that a person is zealous for someone and focuses their attention on that person? Pause this audio here.

Paul then states a general principle: It is not bad to have passion for people, but only if it is for a good reason and only if people are consistent. People should not act passionately only when people like Paul are there to see them.

Paul reminds the Galatians that Paul is passionate and has great love for the Galatians, even though Paul is far away right now. Paul calls the Galatians his children because Paul loves the Galatians and teaches them like a parent teaches a child. Paul feels pain and worry for the Galatians, like a mother who gives birth to a child. Paul will feel this until Christ is formed in the Galatians or until Christ causes the Galatians to act like Christ. Paul wants to be with the Galatians during this process because, right now, Paul is not sure how to help the Galatians. Paul writes this letter to help, but Paul would rather be there with the Galatians and talk to them in person!

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, what would you call people whom you dearly love and take care of? How would leaders or teachers refer to the people whom they teach and lead? Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 4:8–20 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* God
* The false gods
* Basic forces or powers
* An angel of God
* Christ Jesus
* And the false teachers

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "Before you knew God, you were slaves to things that are not really God. But now you know God, or I should say, God knows you. I am shocked that you would turn back and start again to obey those powers. Those powers cannot save you and have no value. When you obey those powers, you become their slaves again! You celebrate the Jewish festivals, which include the celebrations for the days, the months, the seasons, and the years. You do this as if you could earn your salvation by doing this. I fear for you. I am afraid that all my hard work for you was worth nothing."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing God, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I love when people celebrate good things that I have given them or done for them. But I want them to celebrate because they love me and are thankful, not because they think I will do something for them when they celebrate; or
* I am angry and sad when people worship things instead of me. People waste their time when they do that. Those things cannot help people! or
* I caused the Galatians to have a good relationship with me. There was no way for the Galatians to fix their relationship with me on their own.

Ask the person playing the Galatian believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I see the way that people around me do certain rituals or traditions on holy days. People seem to enjoy those rituals or gain a blessing because of those rituals. I want to do the same; or
* I still do not understand how God would save us even though we do not do anything. I always have to pay someone or do something for someone else in order to receive help. Surely I have to do something to earn God's approval.

Continue the drama

Then Paul says, "My dear brothers and sisters, I beg you to live as I do and do not be slaves to the law. I became like you were and am free from the law. You did not mistreat me when I first preached to you. You know that it was because of an illness that I stayed with you the first time and preached the gospel to you. My sickness was hard on you. In spite of that, you did not hate me or turn me away. Instead, you welcomed me in the same way you would welcome an angel from God or even Christ Jesus himself. But now you have lost the joy that you once had. I know that you loved me so much that, if you could have done it, you would have removed your own eyes and given them to me. So then, I am amazed that you act like I am your enemy, just because I told you the truth!"

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing the Galatian believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* It is hard to take care of a sick person. But I could see that Paul is a good man who was teaching true things. I wanted to help Paul; or
* I do remember that I used to feel more joy and thankfulness back when I first heard about the gospel. I wonder what has changed.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I was amazed and thankful for the kind and respectful way the Galatians treated me when I was with them; or
* When I was sick, it was hard to do things. But the Galatians helped me, so that I was able to focus on teaching the truth, which is the most important thing; or
* I am surprised and upset that the Galatians now treat me like an enemy. The Galatians should know that I am their friend and that I want to help them!

Continue the drama.

Paul says, "Those false teachers show great interest in you, but what they are doing is not good. Those false teachers want to separate you from me so that you will show great interest in them. It is always good when someone shows a deep interest in you, but only if their purpose is good. This should happen even when I am not with you. My dear children, like a woman has pain when she gives birth, I am again suffering for you until you truly become like Christ. I would like to be there with you now so that I could speak more gently to you. I do not understand why you are acting this way."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing the false teachers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I like to feel important and respected. I will do anything I can to cause the Galatians to treat me with honor; or
* Paul is not one of our people. Paul is an outsider. I know what is good for our people. We should decide what our people do; or
* I want people to be so focused on me that they do not listen to Paul.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I care deeply for the Galatians, just like a mother cares for her children. I will do anything I can to help the Galatians; or
* I wish I could do more for the Galatians. If I were with the Galatians, I could have long conversations with them. I could show the Galatians by the way I act that the Galatians can trust me and what I say; or
* I am sad that the Galatians are honoring and following teachers who do not care for the Galatians. These teachers will not help the Galatians!

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

The Galatians used to be **slaves** to the false gods. A slave does not receive payment for his work and does not have the freedom to leave his master when he wants. For more information on slave, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for slave as you used in previous passages.

These gods are other spirit beings or idols that people worship as if they have power. Sometimes people use wood or metal to make statues or pillars to represent their gods. Paul also talks about the weak and worthless forces or powers. This includes these false gods, the law, or anything else people would worship and serve. Use the same word or phrase for forces as you used in the last passage.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **gods**. Look up gods in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul calls the believers **brothers**. Since God is the Father of all believers, all believers are like brothers and sisters. For more information on brothers, refer to believer in the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for brothers as you used in previous passages.

Paul preached the **gospel** to the Galatians. The gospel is the way that God has made a way to save people. For more information on gospel, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for gospel as you used in previous passages.

The Galatians welcomed Paul with the same kind of honor and respect they would show to an **angel** of God or Christ Jesus. An angel is a supernatural, spiritual being created by God. Angels give messages from God to people. For more information on angel, refer to angel in the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for angel as you used in previous passages.

**Christ** is a title for Jesus that reminds the believers that Jesus is the Savior. For more information on Christ, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Christ as you used in previous passages.

Paul wonders where the Galatians' joy or **blessing** has gone. Here, blessing probably means the state of well\-being that believers have because they have a right relationship with God.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **joy** or **blessing**. Look up bless in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

The false teachers are zealous for the Galatians, but not for a good reason. When someone is zealous, they are so passionately devoted to someone or something that they are jealous for that relationship to continue. Here, zealous means the false teachers are passionately devoted to continuing the relationship between the false teachers and the Galatians.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **zealous**. Look up zeal in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul calls the Galatians his **children**, though they are not physically Paul's descendants. Paul shows how much he cares for the Galatians when Paul calls them this.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for the affectionate way Paul refers to the Galatians.

Setting the Stage

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 4:21–27 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

Paul has just told the Galatians how worried Paul is because the Galatians return to the way they used to live when they obey the law. In this passage, Paul compares people who want to obey the law to Abraham's sons and those sons' mothers, Hagar and Sarah. Paul says that if a person obeys the law, that person becomes a slave like Hagar and Hagar's children. Believers, however, are free like Abraham's wife, Sarah and Sarah's children.

To begin, Paul says that people who want to follow the law do not really understand the law. To help the Galatians understand, Paul compares the law to the story of Abraham's sons. Remember that at first, Abraham and his wife Sarah had no children. But God promised to give Abraham many descendants. While Abraham was waiting for God to fulfill that promise, Abraham had a son, Ishmael, with his wife's slave, Hagar. Sarah told Abraham to have a child with Hagar because God had not yet allowed Sarah to have children. This was not the son God promised, though. At the right time, God gave Abraham and Sarah a son, Isaac, to fulfill the promise God made.

Stop here and discuss as a group: In Abraham's time, it was not unusual for a man to have a child with a slave woman, but this was not the way God said that God would fulfill his promise. In your culture, what do people think about a man who is married but has a child with another woman? Are there any times when it would not be unusual for a man to have a child with more than one woman? Pause this audio here.

Ishmael was born in a normal human way. When Hagar became pregnant with Abraham's child, Hagar was young and Abraham had not yet become too old a man to conceive a child. Isaac, however, was born as a result of God's promise. God caused Abraham and Sarah to conceive and have a child, even though Abraham and Sarah were old and unable to have children on their own.

Paul explains why Paul talks about these two women and their sons. Paul compares these women to the two covenants or agreements God made to help people understand the two covenants. One covenant is the covenant God made at Mount Sinai, which includes the law. Abraham had a son with Hagar through his own effort, just as people obey the law through their own effort. So Paul compares the law covenant to Hagar. The other covenant, which God made first, is the promise that God made to Abraham and fulfilled through Christ. In the promise covenant, God saves people because of their faith or trust in God. Abraham was able to have a son with Sarah because Abraham relied on God, like people rely on God when they have faith. So Sarah represents the promise covenant.

Paul talks about the law covenant as if it were a slave woman who gives birth to children. In this time, a slave woman's children would also be slaves. Paul compares those slave children to the people who obey the law. The way the Jews obey the law to become right with God causes the Jews to become slaves to the law.

Stop here and discuss as a group: How have people treated slaves in your people's history, or the history of the people groups near you? If a slave woman had children with her master, what would happen to those children? Pause this audio here.

Paul says that Hagar represents the law covenant, as well as the Sinai mountain, where God gave the law. This mountain is the land of Arabia, where the descendants of Hagar's son lived. Paul says that Hagar also represents the city of Jerusalem. Jerusalem was the Jewish capital city, so it represents the Jews. Hagar gave birth in the normal human way, so her children represent the Jews who see themselves as children of Abraham because of their normal, human descent from Abraham. The way that Paul connects the covenant of the law and the Jews with Hagar would have been surprising to the Jews. The Jews thought they were better than Hagar and Hagar's descendants because of the law! The Jews also thought they were better than Hagar and Hagar's descendants because the Jews were the descendants of Abraham's wife, Sarah.

Stop here and look at a map of Israel and Arabia as a group. Find the city of Jerusalem and the Sinai mountain. Discuss this question as a group: What is an important city for your people group or country? If you talked about that important city or what happened in that city, which people group would you be talking about? Pause this audio here.

But the law does not cause people to be Abraham's descendants. Paul contrasts Hagar, who represents Jerusalem, with another Jerusalem, one that is above. This Jerusalem is not a physical place on Earth, but instead the community of believers. Some translations say the heavenly Jerusalem. Paul does not mean that this Jerusalem is in heaven or floating above the Earth, but that it belongs to heaven. People sometimes used the word heaven when they were talking about God. So this means the Jerusalem that belongs to God who lives in heaven.

Paul says it is not the Jerusalem on Earth, or the Jews, who are free. Instead, it is the Jerusalem that is above, which is the community of believers. Paul uses this other Jerusalem to represent several things. This Jerusalem represents Sarah, the free woman, as well as the other covenant. This covenant is the promise God gave to Abraham. Believers who trust in Christ so that God will justify them belong to the Jerusalem above. Believers are not slaves to the law, but are free like the descendants of Sarah, the free woman.

Paul quotes from the Scriptures to further show this. This quote is from a prophecy in the book of Isaiah in the Old Testament, where God told the prophet Isaiah what would happen in the future. At that time, the Jews were not in their homeland, so no one lived in Jerusalem. The author of the passage says that before the Jews left, Jerusalem was like a woman whose husband never left her. But after the Jews left, it was like God had left Jerusalem, too. The author says that when the Jews left, Jerusalem was also like a woman without children. But God promised that one day, God would bring the people back to Jerusalem. And after the people returned, Jerusalem would have more children or people than it did before. It would be a joyful time for people, just like a woman with many children rejoices.

Stop here and discuss as a group: In your culture, how does God give messages to people about the future? What do these messages sound like? How are these messages similar or different from this message that God gave to the prophet? Pause this audio here.

Paul connects Sarah to Isaiah's prophecy because Sarah also had no children at one time. Then God gave Sarah a son and many descendants. Paul also applies this prophecy to the Jerusalem above, which you will remember is the community of believers, the church. Like a woman with many children, the Jerusalem above will have many people and more people than the earthly Jerusalem. Paul means that there will be more believers than Jews. Paul wanted the Galatian believers to understand that all believers belong to the Jerusalem above and are free from slavery to the old covenant. The Galatian believers should rejoice and be glad, just like the woman who now has many children rejoices!

The prophet Isaiah and Paul both talk about the way that God will bless people. God blessed Sarah when God gave Sarah a son. God blessed the Jews when God brought the Jews back to Jerusalem. And now God blesses the believers who become God's children.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 4:21–27 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul says that people who want to obey the law do not truly understand the law. To explain, Paul tells the story of Abraham's two sons.

**In the second part:** Paul explains that Hagar and her son represent the law covenant and the people who obey the law. Sarah and her son represent the promise God made to Abraham and believers.

**In the third part:** Paul quotes from the Scriptures to show why Paul talks about two Jerusalems.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* The people who want to obey the law
* Abraham
* Ishmael, the slave woman's son
* Hagar, the slave woman
* Isaac, the free woman's son
* Sarah, the free woman
* The woman without children, who represents Jerusalem without the Jews
* And the woman whose husband never left her, who represents Jerusalem with the Jews

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Remember how several passages ago, Paul said that Abraham's real descendants are people who have faith in God, not the Jews. Now, Paul talks about that idea again as Paul continues to say how the law causes people to be slaves. Paul talks directly to the people who want to be under the law, or obey the law as part of the law covenant. This includes some believers in the group of Galatian believers. Paul also talks to the false teachers who say the believers must follow the law, even if those teachers are not currently listening. Throughout the passage, Paul talks about covenants, places, and cities as if they were people. Paul does this to help people understand something that may be unfamiliar or surprising.

Stop here and discuss as a group: When are some times when you would compare something that is not a person to a person? In your language, how would you talk about things like agreements or places as if they were a person? Each time Paul compares something to a person, stop as needed and discuss how you want to translate Paul's comparison there. Pause this audio here.

Paul begins the first part with a command and a question. Paul says, "Tell me this," to get the Galatians to think about and focus on what Paul is about to say. Paul speaks formally and forcefully. This shows a change from the previous section where Paul talked very affectionately. Paul asks the people who want to obey the law if they understand what the law says or really means. Paul does not expect the people to answer this question. Paul wants to challenge these people. Paul means that these people do not really understand the law and what they are doing. Paul then shows that he will tell a story from the Scriptures when Paul says, "it is written." Here, Paul does not directly quote from the Old Testament, but Paul does briefly tell a familiar story about Abraham's sons and those sons' mothers. Paul talks about the mothers' statuses first. The slave woman is Hagar, and the free woman is Abraham's wife, Sarah. Paul probably does not immediately say the names of the women because people would know this story.

Stop here and discuss as a group: What is a common story that people in your culture would know? Who are some of the characters in the story that people know and remember? Since people know these characters, what are some ways you could refer to the characters besides their names, such as "the cook's friend?" Pause this audio here.

Paul contrasts the two sons of Abraham. One is the son of a slave woman, while the other is the son of a free woman. Hagar had her son according to the flesh, or in a natural way that a man and a woman conceive and have a child. Sarah had her son as a result of God's promise. God directly caused Abraham and Sarah to conceive, even though Sarah was too old for a normal woman to have a son. The son of the slave woman represents the way that people try to earn God's favor because of their own effort. The son of the free woman represents the way believers have freedom because of what God did for the believers.

Stop here and discuss as a group: In your language, what is an appropriate way to talk about the normal way a man and a woman have a child? Discuss how you want to talk about the way a man and woman have a child in an amazing or unexpected way. Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul explains that Paul uses special language or an allegory. The story Paul tells is a story in which the characters represent something with a deeper meaning. Paul is not saying the original story did not happen. That story actually happened. Paul looks at a real event and finds an additional meaning in that event. Paul uses the similar situation of these two mothers to talk about the two covenants. One covenant is God's promise with Abraham. The other is the covenant God made with the Israelites at Mount Sinai, which included the law.

Stop here and discuss as a group: In your language, what word do you have for a story that has a deeper meaning? Discuss how you want to refer to this true story that has a deeper meaning. Pause this audio here.

Hagar represents Mount Sinai, the law covenant, and Jerusalem. Paul speaks of all four as if they are mothers who have children. The children are the Jews, the people who follow the law. Jews are slaves because of the law, just like Hagar's children are slaves because of Hagar.

Paul also speaks of the Jerusalem that is "above" as a free mother. Paul expects his listeners to understand that Paul is talking about the Jerusalem above in the same way Paul talked about the Jerusalem on Earth. Paul means that Sarah represents the covenant God made with Abraham and the Jerusalem that is above. Sarah's children are the believers. Paul says Sarah is "our mother" to show that Paul is talking about believers. Both the mother and the children are free, just as Sarah was free.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you want to talk about the Jerusalem on earth and the Jerusalem above, or the Jerusalem that belongs to God. Jerusalem was an important city to a people group, so Paul used this city to represent a people group. In your language, how would you refer to a people group that lives in or belongs to a city? Pause this audio here.

In the third part, Paul quotes from the Scriptures. Again, Paul shows how this part of the Scriptures can have a deeper meaning. This quote was part of a message from God to Isaiah, a prophet who gave messages from God to people. When Isaiah first said these words, the message was about the future and the way that God would give Jerusalem even more people than the city had before the Jews left. Paul shows that this passage also shows the way that God causes the heavenly Jerusalem to have even more people than the Jerusalem on Earth.

Like many prophets, Isaiah used special poetic language to share the message. Just like in many Hebrew poems, Isaiah used pairs of words that mean the same things. Isaiah also used parallel or companion phrases, where a poet would say one thing and then add to it in the second half of the companion phrase. Sometimes a poet repeated information or added more information. This quote has three companion phrases.

Stop here and discuss as a group: How is the Hebrew poetic language similar to or different from your poetic language? How do you show that you are about to quote part of a poem or song in your language? Pause this audio here.

Isaiah speaks to Jerusalem as if Jerusalem were a person. Isaiah calls Jerusalem a barren woman and a woman who does not bear children. These are two ways of describing a woman who cannot give birth to children. This is also a companion phrase where Isaiah says the same thing in two ways to emphasize how empty Jerusalem was while the Jews were not in their homeland of Israel.

Then Isaiah tells this barren woman to break forth and cry aloud. Both of these phrases mean to shout for joy. Isaiah is using a pair of words here that mean the same thing. Isaiah is emphasizing that the woman really should do this. This is also a companion phrase, and in the second half of the phrase, Isaiah reminds us who Isaiah is speaking to: the woman who has never felt labor pains to have children.

In the last companion phrase, Isaiah talks about a desolate woman. A desolate or deserted woman refers to a woman whose husband has left her. This is the same woman as the barren woman. Isaiah contrasts the desolate woman with a woman whose husband has never left her. This woman, whose husband has not left, could have children normally. This woman represents how Jerusalem used to be, before the Jews had to leave. Jerusalem used to have many people in it because God was with the people, like a woman who had children with her husband.

With the Jews gone, Jerusalem is like a desolate woman, because God has left Jerusalem. One day, however, this desolate woman will have more children than the woman with a husband, which means Jerusalem will have more people than it had before. Though this has not happened yet, Isaiah talked about it as if it had already happened, because it certainly will happen.

Stop here and discuss as a group: Isaiah refers to this same woman in several ways. What are some ways that you would refer to a woman who has no children? Remember the activity earlier when you talked about ways to talk about a person other than that person's name. When are some times when you might call someone by several different titles other than their name? How do you show that you are still talking about the same person? Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss as a group: In your language, how do you show that you are very certain that something will happen? Pause this audio here.

Though Paul does not say it, Paul applies this quote from Isaiah to what Paul has just talked about. Isaiah compares two versions of Jerusalem to two women. Paul also talks about two Jerusalems, so Paul compares the desolate woman and the other woman to the heavenly Jerusalem and the earthly Jerusalem. The desolate woman will certainly have more children than the other woman. In the same way, the community of believers will have many more people than the Jewish people group.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Paul compares the covenants with familiar stories and places to help the Galatians understand something that may be new or confusing to the Galatians. As an activity, think of something that some people in your group are familiar with but others are not. For example, maybe some of you have visited another place where people act differently from your culture, but others of you have not been to this place. Tell a familiar story to help explain this unfamiliar idea to the other people in your group. Compare the story and the idea to show how they relate to each other. Pay attention to when you choose to say exactly how things relate to each other and when you do not explain as much because you know your listeners understand the comparison. Pause this audio here.

Now stop here and discuss as a group how you will translate the way Paul talks about Abraham's sons, the sons' mothers, the heavenly and earthly Jerusalem, the covenants, and Isaiah's prophecy. Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* The people who want to obey the law
* Abraham
* Ishmael, the slave woman's son
* Hagar, the slave woman
* Isaac, the free woman's son
* Sarah, the free woman
* The woman without children, who represents Jerusalem without the Jews
* And the woman whose husband never left her, who represents Jerusalem with the Jews

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "Listen to me! Some of you want to obey the law. But you do not really understand the law. Let me explain. The Scripture says that Abraham had two sons. The mother of one son was a slave; the mother of the other son was Abraham's wife, who was a free woman. The slave mother conceived and gave birth to a son because of people's plans. But the free woman gave birth to a son because of the promise God made to Abraham."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am upset that the Galatians who want to obey the law do not even know what they are really doing! or
* I care about the Galatian believers, even the ones who want to obey the law. I want those believers to see that it is not good for them to live like this. It is like being a slave; or
* I am thankful that there are stories in the Scriptures that I can use to talk about the Galatians' issue.

Continue the drama.

Then Paul says, "This story has another meaning as well. The two women represent two different covenants that God made with his people. One covenant is the law that God gave on the Sinai mountain. This agreement causes people to be slaves, just as a slave woman gives birth to children who will be slaves. The slave mother named Hagar represents that covenant. Hagar represents the Sinai mountain in the land of Arabia, as well as Jerusalem of our time. Like Hagar and her children are slaves, the people of Jerusalem are slaves. But the free woman represents the Jerusalem above, and we as her children are free\*\*."\*\*

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing the Galatian believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* It is shameful to be the child of a slave woman who was not married. I am shocked that Paul says that people who want to obey the law are like slave children! or
* The Jews have always said that they are descendants of the free woman's son, and so the Jews are special. But Paul says the believers are really the special ones. This is very different than the way we had thought was true; or
* I do not want to be like a slave child, I want to be free!

Continue the drama.

Paul says, "For the Scriptures say,

'Be happy, you childless woman,

You who have never given birth.

Make your voice strong and shout for joy,

you who have not experienced the pains of childbirth,

because the woman whose husband had left her will have many children.

She will have more children than the woman who has a husband.'"

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing the barren woman, who represents the earthly Jerusalem, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am sad that I have no children to love and care for. I am sad because my husband has left me; or
* When I hear this promise, I have hope of what will happen in the future; or
* When I have many children, I will sing and rejoice because I know how sad I was without children. I will be much happier when I have children!

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 4:21–27 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul speaks to the people who want to obey the **law**. This is the set of instructions that God gave the people of Israel. God gave the Jews his laws at the Sinai Mountain. For more information on law, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for law as you used in previous passages.

Paul references the **Scriptures** in this passage. Sometimes people talked about something from the Scriptures without saying the word "Scriptures." Everybody knew that if you said "it is written," you meant something that was written in the Scriptures. The first time Paul says this, Paul means that the full story Paul references is in the Scriptures. The second time Paul says this, Paul directly quotes from the Scriptures. For more information on Scriptures, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same words or phrase to show that Paul is talking about the Scriptures as you used in previous passages.

Abraham had one son with a **slave** woman. In the original language, this is a special term for a slave who is a woman. A slave is a person who does work for someone else. A slave does not receive payment for her work and does not have the freedom to leave her master when she wants. A slave woman's children would also be slaves. For more information on slave, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for slave as you used in previous passages

Abraham had a son with the slave woman because of the **flesh**. When someone does something by the flesh, that person is doing things their own way and with their own strength or ability. For more information on flesh, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for flesh as you used in previous passages

Abraham had a son with the free woman because of the **promise** God made to Abraham. Use the same word or phrase for promise as you used in previous passages.

Paul compares the two women to two **covenants**. When people make a covenant, they make a solemn promise to each other that they cannot break. God made several covenants with people. For more information on covenants, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for covenant as you used in previous passages.

Paul talks about a Jerusalem that is above, or heavenly. Heaven refers to the place where God lives with his angels. This heaven is not somewhere in this universe. This heaven is not a place that humans can travel to. Paul does not mean that this Jerusalem is in heaven, but that it belongs to heaven. People sometimes used the word heaven when they were talking about God. So this means the Jerusalem that belongs to God.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **heavenly** or **above**. Look up heaven in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 4:28–5:1 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In the last passage, Paul compared the two covenants to the mothers of Abraham's sons. Paul now shows how this comparison applies to the believers. The believers are free like Isaac, the free woman's son. The believers should not listen to people who say to obey the law, because people who obey the law are like Ishmael, the slave woman's son. Christ has made the believers free from the law, so the believers must not become slaves again.

Paul says in this passage that the believers are like Isaac. Isaac was the son of Abraham and Sarah, the free woman Paul spoke about in the last passage. Because Sarah was not a slave, Isaac was not a slave. Both Isaac and the believers are "children of promise." Isaac was Abraham's child because God did what God promised and gave Abraham a child. Believers are Abraham's descendants because God did what God promised and sent Jesus to die on the cross so that we could be right with God and become God's children.

Paul calls Ishmael, Abraham's son with Hagar, the son who was born according to the flesh.

Remember, Abraham and Hagar conceived Ishmael in the normal human way. Abraham did this to try to fulfill God's promise to give Abraham a son, since Sarah was not able to have a child with Abraham. But then, after Hagar gave birth to Ishmael, God's Spirit caused Abraham and Sarah to conceive Isaac, just as God had promised. Paul says Ishmael represents the false teachers. Just as Ishmael persecuted Isaac, the false teachers now persecute the believers in Galatia. The false teachers make life hard for the believers when the teachers say the believers must obey the law.

To show how the Galatians should respond to the false teachers, Paul points to the next part in Hagar and Sarah's story. Sarah asked Abraham to send Hagar and Hagar's son away from the household. Sarah did not want Hagar's son to have any of Abraham's possessions as an inheritance. Here, Paul means that Abraham's possessions included the way God promised to bless Abraham. So the son of the slave woman was not a part of God's promise to bless Abraham and Abraham's descendants. Instead, only the son of the free woman would inherit both Abraham's physical possessions and the promise God gave to Abraham.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: When a man dies and that man's son receives his father's possessions, what else does the son receive besides physical items? What are some roles the son takes on? How do people in the family or in the community treat the son because of who his father was? If someone has made an agreement or a promise with the father, and the agreement is not yet finished, how does that person keep the agreement with the son? Pause this audio here.

In the story, God told Abraham to send Hagar and Ishmael away as Sarah asked. Remember, Hagar and Hagar's slave children represent the Jewish law and those people who are slaves to the law. Paul probably quotes this passage to tell the Galatian believers to send away and not listen to or follow those people who told the believers to follow the law.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: As an activity, ask someone else in the group what to do in a specific situation, such as what to do when you have an argument with someone. The other person should answer your question with a story to show what someone in the same situation did. Pause this audio here.

The believers are not like the children of the slave woman who do not inherit and who must leave. The believers are not slaves of the Jewish law or any other religion's rituals. Instead, the believers are like the children of the free woman. The believers inherit or receive the same promise God made to Abraham: that God would make people righteous and save those people because of their faith, not because of what those people do to follow religious laws.

Christ has set believers free from the law in order that believers can live as free people. Paul urges the believers to be sure that they remain free. When people try to obey the law or obey other religions' laws, it is like those people have to carry a heavy load. Paul compares those laws to a yoke. A yoke is a piece of wood that one person wears around his neck to balance and carry two heavy loads. Slaves often carried yokes, so people would often use a yoke to represent the hard work of a slave. The way that people obey religious laws is like being a slave who has a yoke to carry a heavy load.

Stop here and look at a picture of a person with a yoke as a group. In your culture, how do you carry heavy loads? What are some tasks that are hard and no one likes doing?

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 4:28–5:1 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has two parts.

**In the first part:** Paul shows how the two sons represent the believers and those who try to obey the law.

**In the second part:** Paul reminds the believers of Paul's main point: The believers are free, so Paul urges the believers to stay free!

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* Isaac, Sarah's son
* Ishmael, Hagar's son
* The Spirit
* Hagar, the slave woman
* Sarah, the free woman
* And Christ

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Paul had compared the two mothers, Hagar and Sarah, in the last passage. Now, in this passage, Paul talks about the sons, Ishmael and Isaac. Paul speaks directly to the Galatians. In the first part, Paul calls the Galatians "brothers and sisters" to get their attention. Paul then compares the believers to Isaac, who is Abraham's son because of a promise. Paul shows that just like Ishmael treated Isaac badly because Ishmael was not part of the promise, the false teachers now treat the Galatians badly. Paul calls Ishmael the son born by human effort to emphasize that Ishmael represents people who try to become right with God through their own effort. Paul calls Isaac the son born by the power of the Spirit to emphasize that Isaac represents people who are right with God because of what God does for those people.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In the original language, Paul uses Isaac's name, but Paul does not use Ishmael's name. Some translations include Ishmael's name as well. Paul also uses titles for the two sons that explain their roles. As an activity, think of some other ways you could refer to people in the group, such as "the person whose birthday happens soon" or "the person who builds things." When are some times when you would refer to a person not by that person's name, but by one of that person's other titles? Pause this audio here.

Paul then asks a question that he does not expect the Galatians to answer. Paul wants to emphasize what the Scripture says. The Galatian believers would probably know this story, so Paul does not mention what part of the story this quote is from or who is speaking. In the story, Sarah does not like how Ishmael treats Isaac. So Sarah asks Abraham to send Hagar and Ishmael away. Paul quotes Sarah, who says, "The slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman's son." Notice that Paul says "the free woman's son" instead of "my son" as Sarah originally said. Paul changes the wording to keep the meaning clear.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Imagine that someone gave you a message to give to their friend. Perhaps this person said, "Tell my friend I will go with him to the market." When you tell the message to the friend, how will you share the message? If you exactly repeat the message and say, "I will go with him to the market," the friend might be confused! What words will you tell the friend so the friend will understand what the first person means? Pause this audio here.

Isaac inherits or receives Abraham's possessions as well as the promise God made to Abraham. In other words, God's promise applies to Isaac just as it applied to Abraham.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how do you talk about the way that people inherit or receive things that they cannot touch or see? Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul again addresses the believers and calls them brothers. Paul really wants the Galatians to focus on what Paul says here. Paul repeats what Paul has talked about for the last few passages. The believers are not children of the slave woman, but children of the free woman. Believers have a right relationship with God because of what God does for the believers, not because of what the believers do for God.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, when are some times when you would repeat someone's name when you are talking to that person? How do you ask someone to really pay attention to what you are saying? Pause this audio here.

Christ has set the believers free so that the believers can live as free people. Paul tells the believers to stay free, like a person who stands firmly in place and does not move. The believers should not obey the law to try to earn God's approval, which would be hard, like carrying a heavy load or becoming a slave.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Embodying the Text
------------------

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 4:28–5:1 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has two parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* Isaac, Sarah's son
* Ishmael, Hagar's son
* The Spirit
* Hagar, the slave woman
* Sarah, the free woman
* And Christ

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "And so, my friends, you are like Isaac. You are children because of what God promised. However, what happened then is like what is happening now. The son of Hagar was born because humans tried to fulfill God's promise. This son was cruel to Isaac, the one born by the power of God's Spirit. But consider how God's Scripture tells us, 'Send the slave woman and her son away. The slave woman's son will not receive the inheritance with the son of the free woman.'"

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* Just like people could not fulfill God's promise in the past, people cannot fulfill God's promise now. Only God can do what God said he would do; or
* I want the Galatians to see that the false teachers persecute the believers when the false teachers tell the believers to obey the law. The false teachers make life hard for the believers! or
* I am encouraged when I look at the true stories in the Scriptures and see how God acts in a consistent way. God fulfills his promises to Abraham and to us.

Continue the drama.

Paul says, "So then, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, and slaves to the law. We are children of the free woman, and sons of God by faith. Christ has set us free so that we would really be free from the law. So stand strong. Do not change and go back into the slavery of the law."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Christ, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I do not want people to do unnecessary and hard things to try to earn a good relationship with God. I have already done the hard work, which would be impossible for people! or
* I am sad that people focus on the old way of living instead of the good, free way of living I give them. I have given people a good gift, and people instead chose the old way!

Ask the person playing the Galatian believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am embarrassed that I lived like a slave when Christ has already set us free; or
* I become confused when I hear people teach different messages. I am glad that God told Paul, whom I trust, to help us understand the true message; or
* I do not want the other believers to send me away with the false teachers. I will listen to the true message instead of the false teachers.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 4:28–5:1 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul calls the believers **brothers**. When there is more than one brother, the word can also mean brothers and sisters. For more information on brothers, refer to believer in the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for brothers as you used in previous passages.

The believers are God's children because of God's **promise**. Use the same word or phrase for promise as you used in previous passages.

Ishmael is the son of the **flesh**. Remember, Abraham tried to fulfill God's promise by Abraham's own ability and had a son, Ishmael, with Hagar. When someone does something by the flesh, that person does things their own way and with their own strength or ability. For more information on flesh, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for flesh as you used in previous passages.

Ishmael **persecuted** Isaac, just as people persecute the believers. When people persecute you, they treat you in a cruel and unfair way. For more information on persecution, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for persecute as you used in previous passages.

The **Spirit** caused Sarah to become pregnant and give birth to Isaac. The Spirit or the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit is not just a power but also a person. For more information on Holy Spirit, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Spirit as you used in previous passages.

Paul quotes from the **Scriptures**. This is the part of the Bible that believers now call the Old Testament. For more information on Scriptures, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Scriptures as you used in previous passages.

The slave son does not inherit like the free woman's son. A person inherits or receives property and wealth after someone else dies. Abraham's son, Isaac, inherited the promise God made to Abraham. This means that what God had promised to Abraham was now also a promise to Isaac.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **inherit**. Look up heir in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Believers are not children of the **slave** woman. In the original language, this is a special term for a slave who is a woman. A slave is a person who does work for someone else and does not receive payment for their work. For more information on slave, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for slave as you used in previous passages.

Paul compares slavery to a yoke. A yoke is a wooden collar that people use to tie two oxen or two other animals together. Then the animals can walk together to pull a plow or a cart. People can also force a person to carry a yoke if the person is a slave or a prisoner. The slave would use the yoke to carry or pull something.

Stop here and look at a picture of a yoke again as a group as needed. Discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **yoke**. Look up yoke in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there.

Setting the Stage

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 5:2–6 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

Because Christ has set people free from the law, Paul urges the Galatians to continue to live as free people. In this passage, Paul says strongly that the believers must not think that circumcision is a part of the way that Christ saves people. Believers who accept circumcision like this actually separate themselves from Christ! God does not give believers righteousness because of the way people obey the law. Instead, believers have faith in order to receive righteousness.

Remember that the false teachers have taught that if the Galatians really want to become believers, the people must first become Jews and obey the law. Men show that they will obey the law when those men allow someone to circumcise them. Remember that to circumcise someone means to cut off the loose skin at the end of a boy's or man's penis. This ritual shows that a person joins the Jewish people group. When a man accepts circumcision, that man then accepts the idea that a person can earn righteousness through a ritual or by doing what the law requires. Therefore, Paul says that when people accept circumcision, those people also deny that they become free and God's children because of what God does through Christ.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what rituals and actions do you do when you make an important agreement? What do these rituals show to other people? Pause this audio here.

This is not at all what believers should think and do! People used circumcision to show that those people were a part of the covenant that God had made with Abraham. But Paul has just explained that people are included in this covenant because of those people's faith. So Paul tells the Galatians to listen closely to what Paul says. Paul is an apostle, and Paul knows what Paul is talking about. Paul has tried to earn righteousness through circumcision, and Paul knows it does not work. If people accept circumcision, those people choose to do something different than to believe in Christ. Those people reject what Christ has done, so Christ's work has no value for those people.

Paul explains that circumcision is a sign for men that they agree to keep the whole law. There are serious consequences if people choose to follow the law instead of Christ in order for God to justify them or make them not guilty. No one can obey the law perfectly. The Galatians will fail to obey the whole law and so will not earn righteousness. People also cannot accept the righteousness that Christ gives if they also try another way to earn righteousness. When people choose the law, those people reject and separate themselves from Christ. Those people destroy their relationship with Christ, and those people reject God's grace, which is the kind way that God justifies people through faith in Christ.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when someone made good plans for a group event, like a trip or a party, but then the group chose to use someone else's plan for the event instead. When the group rejected the first person's plans, what happened to the relationship between the group and the first person? Pause this audio here.

Paul then talks about believers, including Paul, who have not separated themselves from Christ by choosing the law. These believers do not have to earn righteousness. These believers have faith in Christ, so God has justified these believers. Because believers have this righteousness, believers hope for and eagerly wait for the final day when God will publicly declare that believers are righteous. The Spirit, or the Holy Spirit, helps and encourages believers to confidently hope or expect this day. Remember that earlier, Paul said that believers begin their new way of living with the Spirit. Believers must continue to live their lives with the Spirit.

Believers hope for this day because of Jesus Christ. Because believers trust in Jesus for righteousness, circumcision does not do anything for people. Some believers are already circumcised, and some are not. Both have righteousness only because of Christ. So the way someone circumcises another person does not actually change anything for a believer.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What are some differences between you and your siblings or between your children? How do these brothers or sisters look different from each other? What is it that causes your children to be your children—how they look or something else? Pause this audio here.

What changes people is what people believe. It matters that believers have faith in Christ, not in things like circumcision. And when believers have faith in Christ, believers then show love to other people.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when you met a man and a woman, and you could tell this man and woman were married because of the love they showed each other. What are some other things you can learn about people because of the way those people act?

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 5:2–6 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has two parts.

**In the first part:** Paul strongly warns the believers that they should not accept circumcision to earn righteousness. If anyone does, that person agrees to obey the whole law and thus destroys that person's relationship with Christ.

**In the second part:** Paul says circumcision is not what is important for believers. It is important to have faith in Christ for God to justify us. This faith causes people to show love to others.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers who want to accept circumcision
* Christ Jesus
* God
* Believers who have faith in Christ for God to justify them
* And the Spirit

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In this passage, Paul speaks to and compares two groups of people. One group is the people who listen to the false teachers and want to accept circumcision. When those people accept circumcision, those people agree to try to obey the whole law in order to earn righteousness from God. Men would accept circumcision as a sign that they join the Jewish people group and agree to obey the law. Women could also agree to obey the law, but without circumcision. Paul specifically talks to men who accept circumcision, but Paul also talks to any person who wants to obey the law in order to earn righteousness.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about the rituals or actions for agreements that you talked about in step two. If you heard that someone did one of those rituals, what agreement would you assume that person made? Pause this audio here.

The second group of people is the believers who have faith in Christ for God to justify them. This group includes Paul and the Galatian believers who have not listened to the false teachers.

Paul begins the first scene when Paul tells the Galatians to listen to Paul. Paul says, "I, Paul, tell you this," to emphasize that Paul himself said these words. When Paul does this, Paul reminds the Galatians that Paul is an apostle and has authority from God. The Galatians should listen to Paul instead of the false teachers.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how do you show that people really should listen to what you say? How do you emphasize that a message is really from you? Discuss how you want to translate Paul's words here. Pause this audio here.

Paul speaks to believers who have not yet accepted the circumcision ritual but want to. Paul warns these believers twice to show how important Paul's warning is. The second time, Paul says he declares or testifies that this is true, like someone would solemnly say something true in front of a judge. A man who accepts the circumcision ritual will not think that what Christ has done is important or useful for that man. This is because that man has chosen another method to gain righteousness. This man shows with this ritual that he has agreed to obey the whole law in order to earn righteousness.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how do you show that your warning is very important? How do you show that what you say is certainly true? Pause this audio here.

The false teachers taught that if people obey the law, then Christ will fully save those people. Paul says the opposite is true. If a person obeys the law to try to cause God to justify that person, the person actually separates himself from Christ and rejects the way Christ saves! That person falls away from grace like someone lets go of a rope they are climbing and falls. Paul does not mean that Jewish people who are already circumcised are separate from Jesus. Paul clarifies later that the act of circumcision does not affect people in Christ, or believers. But people who believe circumcision is necessary to be a believer do separate themselves from Christ.

In the second part, Paul talks to the people who do not depend on the law but on Christ. Paul contrasts these believers with the first group. The first group relies on their own effort and the law. The second group relies on Christ and the Spirit. God makes this second group righteous because this second group has faith in Jesus, not because they accept circumcision or obey the law. God has made believers righteous, just like God said God would. God said that one day, when God judges all people, God will declare that the believers are righteous. Believers have hope that God will do what God says he will do. When believers hope, believers confidently expect something to happen because God is consistent and faithful. The Holy Spirit helps believers as they eagerly wait for this day.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how do you talk about something that you confidently expect will happen, such as the way you expect the sun to shine in the morning? Pause this audio here.

The way people are circumcised or uncircumcised does not affect people's good relationship with Christ Jesus. What affects that relationship is whether people trust in Christ Jesus for righteousness or whether they trust in the way they obey the law.

Christ has set people free so that believers no longer need to obey the law. But Christ did not leave people without something to guide how people act. Believers have to love, which the Spirit guides and enables believers to do. This is how believers show that they have faith in Christ.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Embodying the Text

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 5:2–6 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has two parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers who want to accept circumcision
* Christ Jesus
* God
* Believers who have faith in Christ for God to justify them
* And the Spirit

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "Listen to me! I, Paul, assure you that if you accept circumcision in order to become right with God, then what Christ did is absolutely of no use to you. Once more, I warn that everyone who accepts circumcision must obey all of the law. Any of you who try to follow the law in order to be made right with God have separated yourselves from Christ. You have rejected the grace God gives you."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing the Galatians who want to accept circumcision, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am surprised and confused because this seems like a new teaching! I did not realize that I would separate myself from Christ if I accepted circumcision; or
* I thought I would honor God if I accepted circumcision. I wanted to show everyone that I followed God. But Paul says I actually do the opposite!

Ask the person playing Christ, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* People insult me when they try to obey the law and reject the way that I save people. Those people act like they can save themselves better than I can save them; or
* I am sad that people work so hard to do something that cannot help them. Those people only hurt themselves and no longer have a good relationship with me; or
* I want to have a close relationship with people. But when people focus on the law, people are distracted. Those people do not talk to me or ask me for help. Those people think they can save themselves and so they think they do not need me.

Continue the drama.

Then Paul says, "As for us, the Holy Spirit helps us to eagerly wait for the final day when we confidently hope that God will declare us righteous. God will do this because we trust in Christ. When we trust in Christ Jesus, we do not benefit from being circumcised or from not being circumcised. What does matter is your faith that makes you love others."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing the believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am thankful that God justifies us because of what Christ did. There is no way we could do as much as Christ did for us! or
* Because of the love that Christ and God show to me, I want to show love to others as well; or
* I am not worried about what God says about me in the future. In fact, I am actually excited. I look forward to and hope for the day when I will see God do everything God said he would do.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* We do not show that we honor and trust in God by something like circumcision. No, we show this when we love each other. That is our best response to what Christ has done. This is also the best sign to show other people that we have faith in Christ; or
* I am confident that God will do what God said he would. I do not have to worry and try to obey a lot of rules to earn righteousness. I want the believers to be confident and hopeful, too; or
* I feel peace because the Holy Spirit helps me live. I do not have to try to do everything on my own.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 5:2–6 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul talks about people who want to accept **circumcision**. Circumcision, or to circumcise someone, is the Jewish custom where people cut off the loose skin at the end of a boy's penis. If a man who was not a descendant of Abraham wanted to become part of the Jewish people group and a part of the covenant the Jews had with God, that man had to let someone circumcise him. For more information on circumcision, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for circumcision as you used in previous passages

**Christ's** work does not benefit these people. For more information on Christ, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Christ as you used in previous passages.

These people want God to **justify** them because of the way these people obey the law. When a person justifies someone, he declares that person not guilty. When God declares a person not guilty, that means the person is righteous and has a right relationship with God. For more information on justify, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for justify as you used in previous passages

The **law** is the set of instructions that God has given the people of Israel. For more information on law, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for law as you used in previous passages.

These people reject God's **grace**. God gives people grace when God is kind to those people, even though those people do not deserve God's kindness. For more information on grace, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for grace as you used in previous passages.

Then Paul talks about people who have **faith**. Faith means to rely on someone, to trust and believe that what that person says is true. This specific faith that Paul talks about is the way people believe in Jesus. For more information on faith, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for faith as you used in previous passages

The **Spirit** helps these people eagerly wait for the time when God will declare that the believers are righteous. The Spirit, or the Holy Spirit, is the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit is not just a power but also a person. For more information on Spirit, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Spirit as you used in previous passages.

Someone who is **righteous** behaves in the right way. Only a righteous person can have a good relationship with God. When people trust in Jesus, God declares that those people are righteous. One day, God will judge all people. When God does, God will declare that the believers are righteous, and the believers will be with God forever. For more information on righteousness, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for righteous as you used in previous passages

Believers hope for the day when God will do this. This hope is the way that believers confidently expect that something will happen.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **hope**. Look up hope in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there.

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 5:7–12 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

Paul just declared that circumcision does not benefit the believers. So now, Paul warns that the people who say circumcision is necessary are dangerous. Paul also says that God will judge those people. Paul insists that Paul certainly does not teach circumcision and Paul condemns those people who do.

In this passage, Paul again talks about how the Galatian believers acted when Paul was with the Galatians. Paul had seen how the Galatians used to live well as believers. Paul compares the way the Galatian believers lived to an athlete who runs a race. In this time, people would gather together to watch men compete to see who could run the fastest or longest. People would give the winner a prize, so runners run as well as they could to get that prize. Just as an athlete ran his race well, the believers lived in a good and right way. Now, however, someone has tried to stop the Galatians so that the Galatians would no longer obey the true gospel. This is the gospel that Paul taught to the Galatians. The true gospel is that God justifies people by faith, not circumcision or the law.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Describe a dedicated athlete that you know or that is famous in your culture. What did this athlete do to prepare and train for their sport? When this athlete played the sport or ran their race, how did they act? Pause this audio here.

When false teachers say that believers must accept circumcision and obey the law, the false teachers stop the believers from living well. The false teachers' teaching does not come from God. God is the one who calls or invites people to be God's people and to do God's will. God did not say believers must accept circumcision. So the false teachers teach something that is not true.

Paul then quotes a proverb or wise saying to show how dangerous the false teachers' teaching is. Paul compares this teaching to yeast. Yeast is an ingredient that causes dough to rise and become soft bread. People only need to add a small amount of yeast to make a large amount of bread dough rise. During the time Paul lived, people often compared a bad way of thinking and acting to yeast. Just like a small amount of yeast affects bread in a big way, even a small amount of false teaching will affect all the believers in Galatia and harm those believers.

Stop here and look at a photo of bread with yeast. How do people make bread in your culture or the cultures around you? What are some ingredients that you add to food that change the food, even if you only add a small amount? Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what are some proverbs or sayings that people accept as true? How do people share these sayings? Why do people do so? Pause this audio here.

In spite of what the false teachers say, Paul is confident that the Galatians will obey the truth again. The Lord causes Paul to feel confident like this. Paul is also confident that God will punish any person from the group of false teachers who troubles the Galatians. These false teachers trouble the Galatian believers when the false teachers teach things that are not true. It does not matter who the false teachers are. God will certainly punish these teachers.

Paul then addresses something people have said about Paul. In other letters, Paul has said that Paul tries to live like the people with whom Paul wants to share the gospel. Paul does this to help the other people groups listen better to Paul and to better understand what Paul says. When Paul is with the Jews, Paul may do some Jewish traditions. Because of this, someone probably said that Paul still preaches circumcision, or that Paul teaches that a person must accept circumcision in order for God to justify that person. Those people probably said that Paul does not act in a consistent way.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what do people think about a teacher who acts in a consistent way? What do people think about a teacher who acts in an inconsistent way? Pause this audio here.

However, Paul says that these things people say about Paul are not true. While Paul adjusts to all people, Paul does not act in bad ways or teach untrue things. Paul gives proof that Paul does not teach this way. If it were true that Paul says that believers need circumcision, then people would not persecute Paul. People, especially Jews, persecute Paul because of what Paul teaches about the cross. Paul tells how God justifies people through faith because of how Christ died on the cross. This is different from the way the Jews expected God to justify people. The Jews thought God would justify people because of the way people obeyed the law, including the way people accepted circumcision.

If Paul taught circumcision, this would mean that Paul taught that the law was necessary and caused God to save people. Then Paul's teaching about the death of Christ on the cross would no longer cause any trouble for the Jews. But, since Paul's teaching still causes trouble, it is not true that Paul teaches that circumcision is necessary.

Paul then condemns the false teachers in a strong and surprising way. Paul wishes that the people who agitate or trouble the church would emasculate or castrate themselves. Paul is frustrated with these people. Paul shames these people when Paul says this. Paul also mocks these people's message. Some people think that Paul refers to other religions whose members castrated themselves. Paul may imply that circumcision, like these pagan religions, does not cause anyone to be closer to God.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when a group in your community acted in a bad way and told others to act in this bad way too. When people who did not listen to that group talked about that group, how did those people show that they were upset with that group? How did those people shame or criticize the people in that group?

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 5:7–12 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has two parts.

**In the first part:** Paul warns that the people who insist circumcision is necessary are dangerous, but that God will judge those people.

**In the second part:** Paul insists that Paul certainly does not teach circumcision and Paul condemns the people who do teach these things.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* The false teachers
* God, who called the believers
* The Lord Jesus
* And the people who persecute Paul

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Remember that Paul has just talked to believers who wanted to accept circumcision. These believers also believed that God would justify them because of the way these believers obeyed the law. This is surprising to Paul because this is different than the way Paul saw the Galatians act in the past. Paul begins the first part of this passage when Paul compares the way believers used to live well with the way an athlete runs a race well. Paul then asks who hinders or stops the believers so that the believers no longer obey the truth. Paul asks this question to rebuke the Galatians. Paul and the Galatians know the false teachers have stopped the believers from obeying the truth. But Paul wants the Galatians to pay attention to and really understand what the false teachers are doing. When these false teachers tell the Galatians to accept circumcision, these teachers try to persuade or convince the Galatians to no longer obey the truth of the gospel!

Paul answers his own question when Paul says that God did not tell the false teachers to teach about circumcision in this way. Since God did not tell the teachers to teach this, this teaching is wrong and bad. Paul shows that the person who teaches is not important. What is important is whether God told that person to teach.

Then Paul quotes a proverb or wise saying to show how dangerous this teaching is. People may have been familiar with this saying, so Paul does not say that Paul is about to quote something. Paul also does not explain how the wise saying relates to the false teaching. This proverb means that even small things can affect people in an important way. The leaven or yeast represents the false teachings. The dough represents the whole group of believers. Even a little false teaching will spread throughout the whole group and cause problems.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when someone in your community did something in a new way, such as made food in a new or easier way, and then other people started to do that thing too. How would you talk about the way that the first person's way of living spread or affected other people? Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, when you quote a wise saying, how do people know you are saying a quote? When do you first need to say something to show that you will quote a wise saying, and when will people understand if you just say the quote? When are some times when you choose to explain the saying, and when are some times when you do not explain the saying? Discuss how you want to translate the wise saying that Paul says here. Pause this audio here.

Paul then declares that the Lord causes Paul to be confident about two things. Paul means the Lord Jesus. First, Paul is confident that the Galatians will have the same view as Paul. Paul knows the Galatians well, and Paul is confident that when the Galatians hear this letter, the Galatians will agree that circumcision is dangerous. Paul also says this as a reminder that the Galatians should act in the right way.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how would you remind someone that they know the right way to act, and that they should act in that way? Pause this audio here.

Paul is also confident that God will punish any person who causes trouble because they teach false things. This is a warning. God will certainly judge and condemn this kind of person.

In the second part, Paul shows that Paul is not a part of that group of people. Paul asks a question he does not expect anyone to answer. If Paul teaches that believers need circumcision, like some people claim, then why do people still persecute Paul? Paul asks this question to prove that Paul does not preach that the believers need circumcision. If Paul were teaching that believers need circumcision, then people would not persecute Paul. But since people still persecute Paul, the Galatians should know that Paul does not teach that believers need circumcision.

If Paul did teach that believers need circumcision, and therefore also need the law, then Jewish people would not be so angry about the cross. The cross represents the gospel message. This message is that God saves people because those people believe that Christ died on the cross for their sin. Because this true gospel does not include circumcision, it is offensive to the Jews. In the original language, Paul calls the message about the cross a stumbling block. A stumbling block is special language. Just like a person might trip over a stone or block on the ground, Paul is saying that the message about the cross causes the Jews to reject God's true plan because the Jews feel anger or disapproval.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Paul uses one word, cross, to represent the gospel message or the whole story and meaning of the gospel message. In your language, when are some times when you would refer to an object to represent an idea? Discuss if you want to use the cross in the same way Paul does, or describe what the cross represents. Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, what is a general word for something that people stumble or trip over? What do you call something that is hard for people to understand, so it makes people feel anger or disapproval? Discuss how you want to translate the way Paul calls the cross "a stumbling block," or something that causes people to stumble. Pause this audio here.

Paul also shows that Paul does not teach circumcision because Paul harshly criticises and shames the people who do. Paul says these false teachers unsettle or trouble the Galatians. Paul wishes these men would castrate themselves or cut off their own testicles. Paul may not actually want the false teachers to hurt themselves, but Paul wishes these men would hurt themselves instead of hurting the believers. Circumcision would not help anyone, just like castration would not help them either. In fact, if people believe circumcision will cause God to justify them, then they do hurt themselves, because they cut themselves off or remove themselves from God's people!

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Paul speaks about something shameful in order to criticize and shame these teachers. In your language, what is a polite way to talk about castration? How will you show that Paul shames and criticises these false teachers? Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Embodying the Text

Embodying the Text

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 5:7–12 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has two parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* The false teachers
* God, who called the believers
* The Lord Jesus
* And the people who persecute Paul

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "You used to follow Christ well, like a person runs a race well. Then someone stopped you, so you no longer obey the true gospel. This person's teaching is not from God, who called you to believe. Remember the proverb that says, 'A little yeast spreads and makes a lot of dough rise.' And this false teaching is like yeast!"

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing God, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am angry that someone would teach my people lies; or
* I invite people to become my people. Then I help my people live well. I will not send teachers to confuse the believers and tell them something that is not consistent with other things I have said; or
* I am happy when I see how the believers live well. The believers' lives are peaceful, and the believers show love to each other! The believers have a good relationship with me! I am not happy when someone troubles the believers so that the believers can no longer live this way

Continue the drama.

Then Paul says, "The Lord causes me to be confident that you will not believe differently than I do about these issues. I am also confident that if anyone causes you trouble, God will punish that person. It does not matter who that person is."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing the Lord Jesus, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I do not want Paul to worry or be afraid for the Galatian believers. I have reassured Paul that I am more powerful than false teachers and will help the Galatians remember the truth; or
* I am consistent, just like God the Father is consistent. I know that God will punish people who teach lies, no matter who those people are; or
* I care about the Galatian believers and do not want them to believe lies. I am helping the believers in many ways. One way is through this letter that Paul will send to the believers.

> Continue the drama.

Paul says, "My fellow believers, some people said that I still preach that circumcision is necessary. If I still taught that, then people would not persecute me like they do. If I did teach such a message, then no one would be upset that I teach that Jesus died on the cross to save us. I wish that those people who confuse you about circumcision would castrate themselves."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing the Galatian believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I was confused when I heard people say different things about Paul. I did not hear Paul teach that circumcision was necessary when Paul was here. I am glad Paul confirmed what Paul actually teaches; or
* I am shocked that Paul would say that about the false teachers! Those teachers must really act in the wrong way for Paul to shame them like that; or
* When Paul was with us, we did see that Paul's teaching was true. We should listen to what Paul says now, too.

Ask the person playing the people who persecute Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I do not like Paul's message. Paul teaches things that are different than what our ancestors taught us. I do not want to change the way I think and act; or
* I want people to listen to me! I do not want people to listen to Paul, so I will tell lies about Paul; or
* Paul is from the Jewish people group. Paul used to believe the same things we Jews believe now! Paul insults our people group when Paul teaches something different. We should punish Paul for that.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am sad that people tell lies about me and persecute me. I want those people to listen to the gospel and believe instead! Then those people can have a good relationship with God; or
* I am angry and frustrated with these false teachers who lie to the Galatians while I am not there to stop them; or
* I feel worried about the Galatians and the way that the Galatians listen to lies. I am thankful that I can still write to the Galatians and tell them the truth. I am even more thankful that Christ loves the Galatians more than I do and will help the Galatians believe the truth again.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 5:7–12 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

The Galatians no longer obey the truth. Here, although Paul does not use the word "gospel," Paul means the true **gospel** about how God saves people. For more information, refer to gospel in the Master Glossary.

God is the one who **called** the believers. Here, "call" means the way that God invites people to become God's people.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will translate the way that God called the believers. Pause this audio here.

Paul quotes a saying about leaven or yeast, which is a kind of leaven. Yeast is a food ingredient that people mix into bread dough. Yeast causes the dough to rise so that after people bake the dough, the bread is soft to eat. People only use a few grams of yeast with several hundred grams of other ingredients like flour.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **yeast**. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

The **Lord** makes Paul confident. Paul often called Jesus Lord to remind people that Jesus is God, too. For more information on Lord, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Lord as you used in previous passages.

Paul calls the believers **brothers**. For more information on brothers, refer to believer in the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for brothers as you used in previous passages.

Paul does not teach that believers need **circumcision**. Circumcision, or to circumcise someone, is the Jewish custom where people cut off the loose skin at the end of a boy's penis. For more information on circumcision, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for circumcision as you used in previous passages.

People **persecute** Paul because of what Paul preaches. When people persecute you, they are treating you cruelly and unfairly. For more information on persecution, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for persecute as you used in previous passages

The cross offends people. A cross is an upright piece of wood with another piece of wood, called "a crossbeam," attached to it sideways near the top. The Roman people used this as a tool to torture and execute people they thought were the worst criminals. People killed Jesus on a cross. Here, Paul uses the word cross to represent the gospel message of how and why Jesus died on the cross.

Stop here and look at a picture of a cross as a group. Discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **cross** or the gospel message about the cross. Look up cross in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul wishes the false teachers would castrate or emasculate themselves. To castrate someone means to cut off a man's testicles.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **castrate**.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 5:13–18 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In the last few sections, Paul talked about how Christ has set the believers free from the law. In this section, Paul talks about how a free person should live. The Galatian believers should not do sinful things because the believers are free. Instead, the Galatians should choose to do what the Holy Spirit says to do. Because of the way the Holy Spirit leads believers, the law no longer has authority over the believers.

Paul connects two ideas that Paul has talked about in the last few sections. When God invites people to be God's people, Christ sets those people free from the law. So God calls or invites people to be free. But though the believers are free from the law, believers should not think that they should now do anything that they want. Believers should not start to sin and act in ways that do not please God. Paul calls this sinful way of living "the flesh" or "the sinful nature." This is the part of a person that does not want to obey God and chooses to act in a sinful way.

Instead, the believers should show their love for one another. Believers do this when they help and serve one another. The believers should serve one another because the way believers love fulfills or completely obeys the law. Paul has just said that believers no longer need to obey the law, and Paul does not change what Paul teaches. Remember that the law showed God's will, or what God wants people to do. But people broke that law and became unrighteous. Christ died to make the believers righteous, even though the believers cannot keep the law. However, God's will for how people should live has not changed. So believers continue to live in the way God wants, which was the purpose of the law. But when believers love and serve like this, believers do not try to earn righteousness through the law. Believers have faith in Christ, and that kind of faith causes believers to love others.

Paul says that all the different laws together are really equal to only one law. A person must love their neighbor in the same way as that person loves themself. Remember Jesus's story about the Samaritan man who helped a Jewish man, even though the Samaritan and Jewish people groups did not like each other. Jesus showed through this story that a neighbor is not just someone who lives nearby, or a friend, but anyone a believer meets, including an enemy.

People only show this kind of love when people love God. Remember that Jesus also quoted the command to love your neighbor when Jesus summed up the law. Jesus said that the law is all about the way that people love God and other people. Here, Paul writes to believers who love God, and Paul wants to teach how believers should treat other people. So Paul focuses on how the law was about the way people should treat each other.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Talk about the rules you tell children. What is the main reason you give these rules to children? What do you most hope the child will do because the child obeys these rules? Pause this audio here.

Paul tells the believers to love one another because right now, the Galatian believers do not love each other like believers should. The false teachers have caused the Galatians to fight and argue, and Paul has heard about it. Paul compares the way the Galatians treat each other to the way that wild animals act. Snakes and wild animals bite and eat each other. The Galatians probably say angry and hurtful things to each other, divide into groups, and refuse to work together. Paul warns the Galatians that if the Galatians continue to fight like this, the Galatians will completely destroy each other in the same way that fire completely destroys something.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What are some wild and dangerous animals in your area? What happens when these animals see each other? Tell a story about a time when people in your community strongly disagreed on something and were angry at each other. What did those people do? Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when you saw a fire completely destroy something. Pause this audio here.

The Galatians should not destroy each other, but instead, the Galatians should let the Holy Spirit guide them! On their own, human beings want to do things that the Spirit of God does not want believers to do. So our sinful nature and the Holy Spirit are enemies. But the Holy Spirit is with believers and constantly helps believers. If the Galatians listen to and allow the Spirit to guide them, then the believers will not do what people want to do because of their sinful nature. Instead, the believers will do what God wants the believers to do. A believer must choose between two ways to live and must obey either their own sinful nature or the Spirit. Paul says the believers must let the Spirit lead. This means the believers must constantly choose to do what the Spirit says to do.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: As an activity, pick two people to show the group how to do one activity, such as how to climb onto a table or how to kick a ball. Both people should teach two different ways to do this activity. The members of the group should do the activity a few times and choose which teacher's instructions to listen to. Discuss how you choose which teacher to listen to and obey. Pause this audio here.

Because of the Spirit, the believers will then love and do what God wants. The believer does not need the law to do what God wants. The law could not cause the believer to act in the right way, but the Holy Spirit does!

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 5:13–18 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has two parts.

**In the first part:** Paul explains that the believers are free, but not so the believers can do whatever they want. When the believers do whatever they want, the believers act in a way that causes them to fight with each other. Instead, believers are free in order to do what God wants, which is to love the people around them.

**In the second part:** The Holy Spirit enables the believers to love instead of to act in a sinful way. The believers must listen to the Spirit and allow the Spirit to guide them. These believers are not under the authority of the law.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* God
* And the Holy Spirit

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In this letter, Paul has talked to the Galatians about what believers should believe. Now Paul will talk about what the Galatians should do because of what they believe. Paul compares two ways to live: the Spirit's way and the flesh's way. The Spirit guides and teaches the believer to do what God wants the believer to do. Remember that Paul often uses the word flesh to talk about people's way of living when those people do not listen to or obey God.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In an earlier passage, Paul talked about the flesh or the way that people live when they do not obey or listen to God. Review how you chose to translate the flesh there. You will want to use the same or a similar word or phrase here. Discuss how you want to talk about what the flesh wants, or the way people want to act because of their sinful nature. Pause this audio here.

In the first part, Paul explains how the Galatian believers should live because the believers are free. God has called the believers to be free from the law, but not so that the believers can act in a bad way. Instead, the free believers should serve or help one another because the believers love one another. Paul quotes a command that God gave to the people of Israel to show that this is always how God has wanted people to act. God told the people of Israel to love their neighbor in the same way that they love themselves, and Paul says the believers should love one another in this same way. A person takes care of their body and mind and tries to make themselves happy. In the same way, the believers should take care of their neighbors. The Galatians would know that Jesus said that people's neighbors are anyone they meet, not just the people who live near those people. Paul probably wants the Galatians to especially love and serve other believers.

Stop here and discuss as a group: We find God's command to love one another in Leviticus, Matthew, Mark, and Luke. If you have already translated those books of the Bible, you should translate the command here in the same way you did there. If you have not translated this command yet, discuss how you talk about the way that a person takes care of themself in order to keep themself alive and to stay comfortable. How would you say that a person should show the same love and care to other people? Pause this audio here.

Then Paul contrasts God's command to love one another with the way the Galatians actually treat each other. Paul has heard how the Galatians do whatever they want, even if it hurts others. The Galatians fight each other, probably with arguments and cruel words. Paul compares the way the Galatians fight to wild beasts, who bite and eat each other. Paul says the Galatians devour each other, which is a word people use for how wild animals eat food. Animals eat greedily and swallow food without chewing it. The Galatians have acted in a violent and wild way. Paul warns the Galatians that if the Galatians continue to act in this way, the Galatians will destroy each other. This can mean that the Galatians will physically hurt each other, but Paul probably means that the Galatians will ruin each other's lives. This is not how God wants his free people to live.

Stop here and discuss as a group: In your language, how would you talk about the way that people fight each other with arguments and cruel words? What would you compare these fights to? Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul explains how the believers can live in the way God wants the believers to live, instead of in a sinful way. Paul begins this section with the phrase, "What I want to say is this." Paul shows with this phrase that Paul will explain more. Paul has said that the believers are free and no longer have to obey the rules of the law. Instead, believers live in a new way of love, and the Holy Spirit is the one who causes the believers to live like this. Paul tells the Galatians to walk by the Spirit. In the original language, people would use walk to mean the way you live your life. So Paul means the Galatians should choose to live in the way the Spirit guides the Galatians to live.

Stop here and discuss as a group: In your language, how do you talk about the way that people live their lives? How do you talk about the way that people choose to obey or follow someone? Pause this audio here.

Paul wants the Galatians to continue to obey the Spirit. The Spirit is already with the believers, and the Galatians will have to continue to choose to obey the Spirit every day. Often, the believer will still want to disobey the Spirit and act in a way that does not please God. Paul describes these different desires as a conflict between the Spirit and the flesh. The Spirit wants the believer to do different things than the believer's sinful nature wants to do. Paul explains clearly that these two ways of living are opposite or against each other. As a result, the believers cannot do what the believers want to do.

Stop here and discuss as a group: Talk about a time when you wanted to do something different than what you knew you should do. Perhaps you even wanted to do both things, but those things were opposite ways to act! How did you feel as you tried to make a decision? In your language, how do you talk about the way that people want to do more than one thing, or opposite things? What causes people to feel this way? Pause this audio here.

Paul then sums up Paul's main argument. If the Spirit leads or guides the believer, so that the believer obeys what the Spirit says the believer should do, then the believer is not under the authority of the law. God gave the law to the Israelites because of the sinful way the Israelites lived. The law showed the Israelites how they should live in order to please God. But now, the believers no longer need the law because the Spirit shows the believers how to live. The law has no authority over the believer.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Embodying the Text

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 5:13–18 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has two parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* God
* And the Holy Spirit

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "My friends, God called you to be free from the law. But do not let this be an excuse for you to do the evil things you want to do. Instead, help one another because you love one another. If you keep the command, 'Love others as much as you love yourself,' you have fulfilled the entire law. But if you act like wild animals and you hurt and harm each other, be careful, or you will completely destroy each other."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* It makes me sad to hear that the Galatians fight and hurt one another; or
* I am embarrassed that other people see how the believers fight one another. Other people may then think that believers act this way because of what we believe; or
* God called the believers to be God's people, but the believers dishonor God when the believers act like this! The believers do not obey God and do not do what God wants.

Ask the person playing God, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I have always wanted people to love and care for one another. This is not a new or surprising command! or
* Each believer is my child, and I want my children to love and care for each other, not hurt each other; or
* I am sad and upset when the believers act like this. The believers know what I am like and should know that this does not please me.

Continue the drama.

Then Paul says, "What I mean is this: let the Holy Spirit lead you. Then you will not do what your sinful nature wants. The sinful nature wants to do evil, which is just the opposite of what the Spirit wants. And the Spirit wants us to do things that are the opposite of what the sinful nature desires. The Spirit and the sinful nature are against each other. That is why you cannot do what you want to do. If you allow the Holy Spirit to lead you, the law does not have authority over you."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Galatians, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am ashamed and embarrassed that Paul compared us to wild animals because we acted so badly! We have not listened to the Holy Spirit; or
* It is hard not to do bad things like fight with other people. I need someone to help me act in the way God wants; or
* I am thankful that the Holy Spirit leads and guides me. I should learn to listen to the Holy Spirit all the time.

Ask the person playing Holy Spirit, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I know people cannot do what God wants them to do on their own. That is why I teach, lead, and help the believers; or
* I care for the believers and will continue to help them, even when the believers make mistakes; or
* Since I am with the believers, the believers no longer need the law. I can help the believers much more than the law could.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 5:13–18 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul calls the believers in Galatia "**brothers**." When there is more than one brother, the word can also mean brothers and sisters. For more information on brothers, refer to believer in the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for brothers as you used in previous passages.

The believers are free from the law, but not in order to do whatever the **flesh** or their **sinful** nature wants. Flesh is the soft part of a person's body between the bones and the skin. Paul uses the word flesh to mean the sinful way that people live without Jesus. When someone does something their flesh wants, that person does things that God does not want people to do. Some translations call this a person's sinful nature, or the sinful way that people act. Sin is an act of rebellion against God. For more information on sin, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for flesh as you used in previous passages.

When a believer obeys the one command to love other people the way that person loves themself, that believer can obey all that God wanted people to do in God's **law**. The law is the set of instructions that God gave the people of Israel. For more information on law, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for law as you used in previous passages.

A command or a commandment is a law, a rule, or an instruction. God gives commandments to people to show people how to live well, in a good relationship with God and with others.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **command**. Look up commandment in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

A believer should love their neighbor in the same way a believer loves themself. A neighbor can mean people in your community or with whom you come into contact. Here, Paul probably specifically means fellow believers.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **neighbor**. Look up neighbor in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

The believers should allow the **Spirit** to guide them. The Spirit or the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit makes it possible for people to become followers of Jesus. When people start to follow Jesus, the Holy Spirit works inside of those people to help them behave more and more like Jesus, to make them more and more holy. For more information on Spirit, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Spirit as you used in previous passages.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 5:19–26 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In the last passage, Paul said that the Spirit and a person's sinful nature are enemies. In this passage, Paul shows how the Spirit and a person's sinful nature cause people to live in different ways. The believer's sinful nature no longer has control over the believer. Instead, the Spirit gives the believers new life so the believers should let the Spirit guide them.

Remember that in the last passage, Paul said that the Spirit enables believers to obey God, so believers are no longer under the law. But until Christ's return, believers still feel and want to do sinful things, which believers must resist. To begin this passage, Paul gives some examples of those sinful actions. Anyone can easily recognize the kind of things people do because of their sinful nature. People around the believers act in these ways all the time.

Paul first talks about sexual sins like sexual immorality, uncleanness, and sensuality. These refer to all kinds of sexual sins. In this time, in Galatia, people around the believers did lots of sexual activity, and people did not always think it was wrong. It actually would be unusual for someone to act in a sexually pure way. Paul reminds the believers that these sexual sins are opposite to what the Spirit wants believers to do.

Then Paul talks about the way people wrongly worship things that are not the true God. Paul talks about the way people make idols to worship false gods. People practice sorcery or use magic words, objects, or rituals to interact with spirits. This is how the people around the Galatian believers worship, but this is not the way God has said to worship God.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what do people believe about magic, curses, or spirits? How do people worship or serve gods who are not the one true God we hear about in the Bible? Pause this audio here.

Paul then talks about wrong relationships with people. People have all kinds of bad feelings toward each other. When people feel this way, they fight, argue, and break their relationships. Finally, Paul talks about ways that people celebrate and act wild. When a person drinks too much alcohol, that person cannot think clearly. Then that person harms themselves and others. People in Galatia would often have wild parties, where they would drink and eat too much, and do many evil things.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what kind of alcohol do people drink? What is an acceptable amount to drink? What do people think of people who drink lots of alcohol and become drunk? Pause this audio here.

There are more sinful behaviors than these, and the Galatians know what those behaviors are. All believers used to act like this before they believed in Jesus. And believers still sometimes want to act like this. But Paul warns that if a believer keeps living that way without trying to stop or change, then that person will not inherit the kingdom of God.

The kingdom of God does not refer to a country on Earth. This kingdom is everywhere God rules. In this kingdom, people obey God and live in a right relationship with God. All things belong to God, and God shares good things with believers, both now and in the future. The believers inherit or receive these good things when they inherit the kingdom of God. However, the people who continue to do those sinful things do not receive these good things either now or in the future. Those people do not have a part in the kingdom of God.

Stop here and discuss as a group: In your culture, what kinds of bad things might a person do that would keep that person from receiving a gift or inheritance from that person's family? Tell a story about someone you know who did not receive a gift or inheritance because of something he or she did. Pause this audio here.

If the Galatian believers follow the Spirit, the Spirit will cause good characteristics in the believers. Paul compares this to the way God causes fruit to grow in trees. A person is like a tree, and these characteristics are like fruit. A fruit tree naturally grows its fruit, so a believer who lets God's Spirit lead them will naturally develop this "fruit" or good things. This fruit, or character, is different from the gifts that the Spirit gives to people. Gifts are functions and abilities that the Spirit gives to various people, like the ability to teach. The Spirit gives different gifts to different people. However, the Spirit gives this same fruit to each believer who lets the Spirit of God lead the believer.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What fruit trees or plants grow in your area? When you see one of these plants, what do you expect to find on the plant? Pause this audio here.

Paul talks about love first. Remember that Paul already mentioned love earlier, as the way the believers should serve one another. Paul often says love is the most important thing a believer can show. Some people say that all of these characteristics come from or are connected to the way people love well. All the characteristics the Spirit causes in believers are characteristics that God has. The Spirit causes God's people, God's children, to be more like God!

No law can cause people to live in these good ways, and there is no law that says people should not live this way. Like Paul said earlier, people who let the Spirit guide them actually accomplish everything the law says to do.

Paul reminds the Galatians that believers' sinful natures no longer control the believers. Paul compares the way the believers have stopped their own sinful nature to someone who kills another person on the cross. Both have stopped or ended something. That old way of living has gone away, like a dead person. Just like a dead person cannot control anyone, the believers' sinful nature does not control the believers anymore.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when someone completely stopped an activity, like going to a certain job or going to school. How did the person learn to live their life differently after they stopped that activity? What did that person have to change or learn? Pause this audio here.

Instead, these Galatians have received new spiritual life from the Spirit. So the believers should let the Spirit guide the believers. Like when a person follows a leader's steps on a path, believers should do what the Spirit says to do. This is why the Galatians should no longer fight, as Paul has heard that the Galatians do. The believers should not be proud and always say how great they are. Believers should not irritate each other and challenge each other to fights. Those things are all part of the old way of living!

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 5:19–26 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul gives examples of how people act in sinful ways. People who continue to do these things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

**In the second part:** Paul describes the characteristics that the Spirit causes believers to have.

**In the third part:** Believers have put to death their sinful nature and the Spirit has given the believers new life. So the believers should obey the Spirit.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* The people who do not inherit the kingdom of God
* God
* The Spirit
* And Christ Jesus

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Paul said in the last passage that the flesh and the Spirit are against each other. Now, in this passage, Paul further compares these two ways of living. Though Paul says the sinful way of life is obvious, Paul gives many examples. In this time, teachers would often contrast bad and good behavior to teach people how those people should live.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, how do teachers tell people the right way to live? What are the ways of life that you respect in your culture? What are the ways people live that you do not respect? Pause this audio here.

In the first part, Paul gives examples of sinful ways that people act. Paul may mention the sexual sins because these were very common in Galatia at this time, but there is no specific order to these actions. Remember that these are just some of the many ways people act when they do what their sinful nature wants. Paul does not need to talk about all of these actions because the Galatians can easily see how people act in a bad way.

First, Paul talks about sexual sins. People are sexually immoral or unfaithful. This is a general way to talk about any kind of sexual sin, like having sex with someone you are not married to. People are sexually unclean or impure, which means people do shameful sexual things. People are sensual or depraved. Some translations say licentiousness or debauchery. This means people are overly sexual and indecent. These people no longer feel shame for what these people do.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What words or phrases do you have to talk about sexual immorality, impurity, and sensuality? Discuss how you want to talk about these things in an appropriate way in your language. Pause this audio here.

Then Paul talks about wrong religions and ways to worship. People worship false gods and those gods' images and statues, as well as anything that is not the one true God. People also do sorcery or witchcraft. This is when people use magic words, objects, or rituals to interact with spirits.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What words or phrases do you have to talk about the way people worship idols and interact with spirits? Discuss how you want to translate these here. Pause this audio here.

Next, Paul talks about the wrong ways that people treat each other. Paul uses eight or nine different words to describe these sinful actions. If you have a word in your language that combines the meaning of some of the words Paul says, you might be able to translate this with fewer words than Paul uses.

People feel enmity or hatred towards each other and so become enemies.

People cause discord, which means people disagree and are not willing to get along.

People feel jealous or want what other people have.

People feel intense anger and show that anger in a way that hurts other people.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What words or phrases do you have in your language to talk about the way people feel hatred, discord, jealousy, and fits of anger? Discuss how you want to translate these here. Pause this audio here.

People selfishly want to be more important than other people and work only for themselves, which causes rivalries.

People have dissensions, which means people argue and are angry with each other because they do not agree.

People divide or have factions. This means that because people argue, people then separate from one another and create different groups or factions.

People feel envy, which is similar to the way people are jealous. People want to take away what another person has because they have bad feelings toward that person.

A few translations include murder here as well.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What words or phrases do you have to talk about the way people have selfish rivalries, dissensions, factions, and envy? Discuss how you want to translate these here. Pause this audio here.

Paul then talks about the ways that people do not control themselves. People become drunk when they drink too much alcohol. People have orgies or wild parties where they drink too much and do many evil things.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What words or phrases do you have to talk about the way people drink too much alcohol and celebrate in wild ways? Discuss how you want to translate these here. Pause this audio here.

Paul warns the Galatian believers about people who continue to live like this. These people do not have a part in God's kingdom. These people do not inherit or receive something that God promised to give them. Paul has warned the Galatians about this before, probably when Paul was in Galatia.

In the second scene, Paul contrasts the way people act in a sinful way with the Spirit's work in a believer. People act in those bad ways because people choose to do sinful things. But when believers choose to do what the Spirit says, the Spirit causes these characteristics to be in or grow in the believer. Paul compares these characteristics to fruit. Notice that Paul only talks about one fruit. This shows that the Spirit produces all nine of these qualities in a believer, not just some.

The Spirit causes believers to love God and others well.

The Spirit causes believers to feel joy. This means believers feel glad and happy about who God is and what God does. Believers feel joy even in bad circumstances because God is always with believers and does not change.

The Spirit causes believers to have peace. When believers live in peace, they are completely well. The believers have a complete life and live in harmony with each other, with nature, and most importantly, with God!

The Spirit causes believers to have patience. This means that believers do not become angry even when someone insults those believers. Believers are ready to forgive people and do not complain.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What words or phrases do you have to talk about the way people have love, joy, peace, and patience? Discuss how you want to translate these here. Pause this audio here.

The Spirit causes believers to be kind.

The Spirit causes believers to be good. No one can say anything bad about the believers. This also means that believers are generous and are happy to do more than the believers have to for others.

The Spirit causes believers to be faithful. Faithful people are loyal and honest. People can trust the believers.

The Spirit causes believers to be gentle. Gentle people are considerate and humble, not harsh or proud.

The Spirit causes believers to have self\-control. This person is able to control their own actions and live in the way God wants.

Paul says that there is no law against these actions. Paul means that people everywhere agree that these actions are right. So there is no law that says people should not live this way.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What words or phrases do you have to talk about the way people have kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self\-control? Discuss how you want to translate these here. Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you want to translate the way Paul says that there is no law that says these actions are wrong. Pause this audio here.

In the third part, Paul talks about the way that the believers have stopped their old, sinful way of life. Paul calls the believers "those people in Christ" or "those people who belong to Christ." Paul says the believers have crucified their sinful nature. Paul says this to remind believers that when they believed in Christ, who died on a cross, it was as if the believers killed their sinful nature. Paul talks about the sinful nature's passions and desires, which mean almost the same thing. These are the desires that people have because of their sinful nature. Now, a believer's sinful nature no longer controls the believer, just like a dead thing does not control anything else.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how do you talk about the way that people stop something, like in the story you told about the person who stopped an activity? How will you talk about the way the believers' crucified or stopped the sinful nature? Pause this audio here.

The believers have chosen a new way of life because of the new spiritual life the Spirit has given to the believers. However, the believers must still learn to live in a new way and not return to the old way of life. So the believers should live in the way the Spirit says to live. Paul uses lots of words to describe how believers live now. Believers live and walk by the Spirit. The Spirit leads and guides. These all mean about the same thing. The believers should listen to and obey the Spirit. Paul talks several times about the way the Spirit guides to show how important this truth is for the believers.

So now, the Galatian believers should not be conceited or proud. The believers should not irritate and envy each other. This is what caused the Galatians to fight!

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Embodying the Text

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 5:19–26 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* The people who do not inherit the kingdom of God
* God
* The Spirit
* And Christ Jesus

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "Anyone can see the way that people act because of their sinful nature. People are sexually unfaithful, impure, and take part in many sexual sins. People worship things that are not God and do witchcraft. People hate each other, fight, become jealous of each other, are violently angry, and want to take away the good things other people have. People argue, separate into different rival groups, and want the possessions of other people. People become drunk, celebrate in evil ways, and do many other wrong actions like these. I have warned you in the past, and I now warn you again, that people who do things like that will not have a part in the kingdom of God."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing God, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am angry that people hurt each other and have bad feelings toward each other. This is not a good way for people to live! This is not the way I told people to live; or
* I love the people I have created, and I do not want people to destroy each other. I am sad when people hurt themselves and make their own lives hard; or
* People are a part of my kingdom when they have a good relationship with me. These people trust and obey me. I lead, protect, and care for these people. If people do not trust and obey me, then those people do not have a good relationship with me and are not in my kingdom.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I have seen how groups split and destroy each other when they act like this. I do not want the believers to live like this; or
* God has told us the best way to live. I want the believers to live well, not in this sinful way that does not honor God; or
* There are serious consequences if the Galatian believers continue to ignore what God has said and act in a sinful way! I do not want that to happen to the Galatians, so I will warn, teach, and encourage the Galatians however I can.

Continue the drama.

Then Paul says, "However, the Spirit causes good characteristics in a believer, like a tree that grows good fruit. The believer loves others, is joyful, lives in peace with others, and endures whatever happens. The believer is kind, good, faithful, gentle, and has control of himself. There is no law that says these things are wrong."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing the Spirit, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I want believers to live well here on Earth, so I will cause good characteristics in the believers; or
* God, Jesus, and I act in these ways, so we have peace with each other. I want the same thing for the believers; or
* I love to give good things to the believers! I feel happy when the believers are joyful and kind to each other! I love to see the believers follow God's example in the same way that children act like their father!

Ask the person playing the Galatian believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* When Paul compares those two ways of life, I can see that it is much better to let the Spirit lead me! or
* I want to live in peace with others and learn to have these characteristics. I am so thankful that the Holy Spirit causes these characteristics in us believers; or
* Paul was very serious about what will happen to people who live in a sinful way! I am ashamed that I acted in those ways.

Continue the drama.

Paul says, "People who are Christ Jesus' people do not allow their sinful natures to rule them. It is like these people have crucified their sinful nature with its passions and desires. The Holy Spirit has given us new life, and so we should live as the Holy Spirit wants us to live. We should not be proud, and we should not irritate and envy each other."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* When people become Jesus's people, their whole lives should change! I want the believers to understand how important this is! or
* I am worried about the Galatians. The Galatians have forgotten that believers no longer live in the old way; or
* I am so thankful that the Holy Spirit has given us new life. I am so glad for the good fruit that the Holy Spirit has given us!

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 5:19–26 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul talks about the way people act because of their **flesh** or the sinful nature. Flesh is the soft part of a person's body between the bones and the skin. Paul uses the word flesh to mean the sinful way that people live without Jesus. When someone does something their flesh wants, that person does things that God does not want people to do. Some translations call this a person's sinful nature, or the sinful way that a person acts. Sin is an act of rebellion against God. For more information on flesh, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for flesh as you used in previous passages.

Paul lists 15 different sinful behaviors.

First, Paul talks about sexual immorality. This can mean any kind of sexual sin. Usually, when someone is immoral, that person does some kind of sexual sin when they are not married.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **sexual immorality**. Look up immorality in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Then Paul talks about impurity or uncleanness. In the Bible, the words "clean" and "unclean" do not refer to whether something is clean or dirty on the outside. In the Bible, a clean person means someone who is fit for service to God, someone who is acceptable to participate in worship to God. A person who is unclean is unfit for service to God. Here, Paul means the way people make themselves unclean when they do a shameful or wrong sexual activity.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **impurity**. Look up unclean in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Later, Paul talks about idolatry. This is the way people worship an idol. An idol is an object that people make in order to worship a god. The object reminds people about some characteristics of this god.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **idolatry**. Look up idol in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

People who do these things will not **inherit** the kingdom of God. A person inherits or receives property and wealth after someone else dies. God will never die, so this does not mean that people will inherit after God dies. In the Bible, people use inherit to mean the way God blesses people as God promised. Believers inherit the good things that Jesus shares with all the people who trust in him as Savior. Believers also inherit or receive a place in God's kingdom. For more information on inherit, refer to heir in the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for inherit as you used in previous passages.

The kingdom of God is not a country on Earth but is a way to describe everywhere God rules. In this kingdom, people obey God and live in a right relationship with God. Because of Jesus, it is now possible for people to live in a right relationship with God and be a part of God's kingdom.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **kingdom of God**. Look up "kingdom of God" in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul then talks about the fruit of the **Spirit**. The Spirit or the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit is not just a power but a person. For more information on Spirit, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Spirit as you used in previous passages.

The Holy Spirit causes the believers to have **peace**. When people live in peace, they are completely well. Those people have a complete life and live in harmony with each other, with nature, and most importantly, with God! For more information on peace, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for peace as you used in previous passages.

There is no law against these things. This refers to any kind of law, including the laws a government makes and the law that God gave to the Israelites.

Paul calls the believers people who belong to **Christ** Jesus. For more information on Christ, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Christ as you used in previous passages.

Believers **crucified** their sinful nature. When someone crucifies someone, they kill that person on a cross. People used a cross as a tool to torture and execute people they thought were the worst criminals. For more information on crucify, refer to crucifixion in the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for crucified as you used in previous passages.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 6:1–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

Paul has told the Galatians to let the Spirit lead the Galatians. Now Paul talks about how the Spirit wants believers to act in specific situations. The believers should help one another in a gentle and humble way. Believers should not be proud but should act in a good way towards all people. Paul reminds the Galatians that God will one day reward or punish people for the way those people act.

If believers walk by the Spirit, those believers will live in a good way and can help other believers who start to sin. Though the Spirit has given the believers new life, the believers will make mistakes and sin, so Paul first talks about what to do when this happens. Paul calls some believers spiritual, which means people who are mature and who obey the Holy Spirit. These believers have the fruit of the Spirit, like gentleness, and so can help a believer who has sinned.

These mature believers must help the believer who has sinned to no longer sin. The mature believers should gently help the sinful believer come back into a right relationship with God and other believers. As the mature believers help the sinful believer, the mature believers must be careful not to sin as well.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when someone in your community acted in a wrong way and you wanted to help this person act in the right way. How did you help this person? Why did you help this person? Pause this audio here.

This is just one way that the believers should help each other. Paul says the believers should help each other in any kind of problem or difficulty, such as pain, suffering, or weakness. Paul compares these difficulties and problems to a burden or something that is heavy for a person to carry. Like someone who helps another person carry a burden, the believers help other believers with problems. When believers help each other, believers obey Christ's command to love each other.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when you had a difficult problem or something that was hard for you, and another believer helped you. How did you feel before that person helped you? How did you feel when that person helped you? Pause this audio here.

As the believers care for and help each other, a believer should not think that they are better than the person they help. Remember in the last section that Paul said the believers should not be proud or conceited. If the believers think they are better than others, believers cannot feel true kindness or care for other people. These believers just lie to themselves. These believers are not more important or better than other believers. In fact, if a believer is conceited, it is easier for Satan to tempt that person, which Paul has just warned about!

Instead, each believer should evaluate or carefully think about their own work. Here, work means the way a person acts, as well as the tasks and responsibilities that God gives people to do. Each believer must make sure that they act in a right way. Then the believer can feel proud in a good way and rejoice when they do something good. The believers should not compare themselves to other people, and be happy only if they feel like they are better than others. This does not show love or help other believers.

Paul compares the responsibilities that God gives to each believer to a load or bag that a person carries. Each believer must concentrate on doing their own work, like a person carries their own bag. Paul means that the believers are responsible to God for their own lives and the way they act. This is different than the burdens Paul told the believers to help each other with. Paul is clear that though believers are responsible for their own actions, believers must also help each other.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about someone who was proud and constantly compared what they did to what others did. How did other people feel about this proud person? How helpful was this proud person? Pause this audio here.

Paul gives a specific example of the way believers should help each other. Paul talks about how believers should treat teachers. These teachers are people who teach God's word or the message of the gospel to others. These teachers teach all the time, so these teachers may not have enough time to earn money through other work. The people who learn from these teachers should willingly give money or goods to support the teachers. It is possible that the Galatians did not provide for their teachers and that someone told Paul about this.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, how do people treat teachers? How do you show that you appreciate and care for teachers? How do people expect teachers to get food or money to live? Pause this audio here.

Paul then warns the Galatians to be careful how they act. A person cannot deceive God. A person cannot claim to believe in Jesus and at the same time continue to live in a sinful way. The Galatians deceive themselves if the Galatians think that God will not see their sin and punish them.

Paul explains with a well\-known saying. Whatever a man plants in his field, that is exactly what that man is going to harvest. Paul compares how people plant and grow crops to how people live. What people do while they are alive is like what a man plants. People will one day receive something good or bad from God because of how those people lived. This is like how a person reaps or harvests plants that grow. Paul uses this saying to explain that God will treat people according to their actions. God will reward people who obey the Spirit. God will punish people who sin.

Paul compares a person who does things because of his sinful nature to a person who plants seeds in contaminated or bad soil. A person does not gather good plants from bad soil. In the same way, a person who lives in a sinful way receives corruption, which means that this person will completely die. Paul then compares a person who does things that please the Holy Spirit to a person who plants in good soil. A person gathers good plants from good soil. In the same way, the person who obeys the Spirit receives eternal life. Eternal life means a life with God that will never end. Paul does not mean that believers have to do certain actions for God to save those believers. Paul has already said that God saves people because of faith. But the people God saves should obey the Spirit, and God will reward those people for how they act.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when you or someone you know planted seeds in good soil and took care of the seeds. Then tell a story about a time when you planted seeds in a bad place. What kinds of plants grew in each soil? Pause this audio here.

So Paul encourages the Galatians not to become discouraged and give up doing what is good. At the right time that God chooses, God will reward the believers, just like a person gathers a good harvest of plants at the right time. So while the believers have the opportunity, which is while they are alive, the believers must do good to everyone, especially the other believers. The believers are a part of God's family and should take care of each other like a family should!

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Talk about some common plants that people grow for food. When are those plants fully grown and ready for people to gather food from them? Who causes the plants to grow and be ready? What do people have to do while they wait for the plant to grow?

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 6:1–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has two parts.

**In the first part:** Paul talks about how the Spirit wants people to act in specific situations. The believers should gently help and support each other. The believers should not be proud and deceive themselves but should appropriately think about what they work at and do.

**In the second part:** Paul explains that God will punish people who sin and will reward those who obey the Spirit. So the Galatians must not give up but instead continue to treat every person well.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* The believer who sins
* The Spirit
* Christ Jesus
* People who teach God's word
* And God

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Paul begins the first part when Paul calls the believers brothers. Again, Paul shows that Paul loves the Galatians and is concerned for the Galatians. Paul also reminds the Galatians that believers are members of a family, just as Paul says again at the end of the passage. Members of a family have a responsibility to care for and love each other.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, how should family members treat each other? When a person is in trouble or in a difficult situation, what should that person's family do to help that person? Pause this audio here.

Paul begins with one way that believers care for each other. When one believer sins, believers who obey the Spirit should gently restore that believer. Paul uses a word that means to repair something to its original condition, like the way people repair a fishing net or set a broken bone. In the same way, the other believers help the believer who sinned to obey the Spirit again. Those believers remind, encourage, and correct the believer who sinned. Paul warns the believers who help that believer to be careful. As the believers talk about that sin, and maybe deal with things that make people want to sin, the believers may feel tempted or want to sin. The believers may want to feel proud that they did not sin like the believer who did sin. Those believers may have bad feelings toward the believer who sinned. Paul says not to do this!

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how do you talk about the way that people feel an urge to sin or want to sin? How would you warn someone to be careful not to do that sinful thing? Pause this audio here.

Believers should help each other, like a person helps another person carry something heavy. Believers should help in all kinds of situations, such as when people suffer or do not have something they need. In this way, the believers fulfill or obey the law of Christ. The law of Christ is Jesus's commandment to love one another.

Paul warns the believers not to think they are more important than others or too important to help each other. People who think these things lie to themselves. One believer is not better than another. The Spirit does not want people to be proud like this, but gentle.

Instead, each believer should pay attention to their own work. If a believer's work is good, the believer can be proud or rejoice that they have done what God has said to do. When believers do not deceive themselves, those believers can see how the Spirit has led them. The believers do not have to sinfully compare themselves to other people to prove that they are better. The believers can rejoice about what God has done in their own lives!

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Paul talks about two ways people think well of themselves. One is the way that people think they are better than other people. This is a sinful kind of pride. Paul also talks about the way people feel glad and rejoice because they do their work well. What words do you have in your language to talk about these two different ways that people think well of themselves? Pause this audio here.

One way the believers can help each other is to support the people who teach God's word. These people may be people like Paul, who spend all their time teaching others about God. The believers who learn from these teachers share good things like food or money with the believers who teach.

In the second part, Paul again tells the believers not to deceive themselves. This is a common warning. Paul means that the Galatians can be very sure that no one can mock or cheat God. Paul quotes a proverb that the Galatians are probably familiar with, so Paul does not say that Paul quotes something. Paul says, "What a man plants in his field is also what that man will harvest." Paul then explains how the saying applies to the way people live. Paul talks about the flesh and the Spirit as two kinds of fields that give different harvests. People choose to obey one or the other, like a person who plants in either good or bad soil. People receive decay or die because they obey the flesh, or receive eternal life because they obey the Spirit.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Paul quotes a proverb or wise saying. In your language, how do you show that you quote a wise saying? Discuss how you want to translate how Paul compares the way people live their lives to how people grow plants. Pause this audio here.

Because of their hope for a good reward, the Galatians should not become tired or discouraged, but instead should continue to do what is good. Paul talks about what will happen in due time or the time God has chosen. Paul probably means when Jesus returns. Then God will reward the believers. So the believers should do good to everyone, especially fellow believers, who are all a part of God's family.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Embodying the Text
------------------

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 6:1–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has two parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The Galatian believers
* The believer who sins
* The Spirit
* Christ Jesus
* People who teach God's word
* And God

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "Brothers and sisters, if someone in your group does something wrong, you who follow the Spirit should gently help make that person right again. But be careful not to give in to the same temptation yourself. Problems and troubles like these are like a burden. Help one another carry these burdens. When you help each other, you follow the law that Christ taught."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Christ, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I love the believers and want them to love each other too; or
* I know this life is hard, so I want the believers to love and help each other; or
* Sometimes, believers who sin do not know that they sin, and they convince others to sin too. I want the other believers to be careful not to do what those believers do.

Ask the person playing the believer who sins, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am ashamed that I have sinned. I do not even want to talk to the other believers in case they shame me even more; or
* I do not know how to stop the way that I sin. I need help! or
* I am sad and tired because of the hard things in my life. It is easier to sin than to do what is right.

Ask the person playing the believers who help the person who has sinned, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I love this believer who has sinned. This believer is my friend. Of course, I want to help this believer! or
* I feel sad when another believer is in trouble or pain. God has given me the ability and resources to help, so I will! or
* I remember how kind other believers have been to me when I was in trouble. I want to help those believers in the same way.

Continue the drama.

Then Paul says, "I say these things because if anyone thinks that they are an important person, when they are not, then that person lies to themself. Each person must look at their own actions and see if they are good. If they are good, then that person can be glad about what they have done. That person should not compare their deeds with another person's deeds. We must each do the work that God has given each of us, like someone who is responsible to carry his own load. When someone teaches you the word of God, you should share the good things you have with the person who teaches you."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel frustrated when believers think they are too important to help others. God is the most important of all, and God helps us, even when we disobey God! Believers should follow God's example; or
* God gives us good work to do and helps us do that work. We cannot do our own work if we just compare ourselves to others; or
* I know what it is like to teach all day and wonder how I will get food for the day. God provides for me, and one way God provides is the way that other people support me. I want the believers to support other teachers, too.

> Continue the drama.

Paul says, "Do not lie to yourselves. You cannot cheat God. I say this because what a man plants in his field is also what that man will harvest. The person who does what pleases his sinful self is like a person who plants seeds in bad soil. That person only receives death, like a person who gathers bad crops. The person who does what pleases the Spirit is like a person who plants seeds in good soil. That person receives eternal life, like a person gathers good crops. So do not become discouraged and no longer do what is good. If we do not give up, we will receive eternal life at the right time, like a good harvest. Whenever we have the chance, we should treat every person well, especially those who are fellow believers."

Pause the drama. Ask the person playing God, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I can see everything people do and think. I know when people lie to me; or
* People who sin harm themselves and others. I do not want my people to harm themselves and others; or
* Believers show that they are my people when believers obey the Spirit. I know that is hard sometimes, and I can see their hard work. I will reward the believers for the way the believers continue to obey the Spirit.

Ask the person playing the Galatian believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* When I obey the Spirit but life is still hard for me, I feel tired and discouraged. But I am encouraged that God knows what I do and is pleased with me; or
* I look forward to the day when God will give people what they deserve. I am not worried about that day, because I know God will declare me righteous because of what Jesus did and then reward me for how I acted on Earth; or
* I am thankful that the other believers can help and encourage me when it is hard to live the way God wants. Even now, though Paul is far away, Paul helps us with this message. I want to help other believers, too.

Listen to an audio version of Galatians 6:1–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul calls the believers in Galatia "**brothers**." Since God is the Father of all believers, all believers are like brothers and sisters. For more information on brothers, refer to believer in the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for brothers as you used in previous passages.

Paul talks about what to do when a believer **sins**. Sin is an act of rebellion against God. For more information on sin, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for sin as you used in previous passages.

The believers who obey the **Spirit** should help the believer who sins. The Spirit or the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God. For more information on Spirit, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Spirit as you used in previous passages.

When believers help each other with their difficulties, the believers obey the law of Christ. This is the command that Jesus gave to his people to love others. Christ is a title for Jesus that reminds the believers that Jesus is the Messiah. For more information on Christ, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Christ as you used in previous passages.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **law of Christ**. Pause this audio here.

Believers should support people who teach the word, or the word of God. The word of God means everything that God tells people. When people in the New Testament talk about the word, they usually mean the good news that Jesus has come into the world.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **word**. Look up "word" in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul says that no one can mock God. Paul means that it is not possible for people to cheat or trick God.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **mock**. Pause this audio here.

Paul compares the way that people live to the way that a person plants crops. People sow or plant seeds. Then people reap or gather the harvest, which is the plants that grow from those seeds.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use to talk about the way that people **plant**, **grow**, and **gather the harvest**. Pause this audio here.

Paul talks about people who do what pleases the **flesh**. Paul uses the word flesh to mean the sinful way that people live without Jesus. When someone does something their flesh wants, that person does things that God does not want people to do. Some translations call this a person's sinful nature, or the sinful way that people act. For more information on flesh, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for flesh as you used in previous passages.

People who live to please the Spirit receive eternal life. Eternal life means a life with God that will never end. Eternal life is a much better and richer life than ordinary life. Without this gift of eternal life, we may live and breathe, but this is only physical life, and it will end as soon as we die. But the eternal life that God gives us will never end! This eternal life begins now, changing us and making it possible for us to live in a close relationship with God.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **eternal life**. Look up eternal life in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

The believers should do good to all, especially to the household or family of the faith. Sometimes, people use the word household to talk about people who have something in common. Here, when Paul says "household of faith," Paul means all the people who have faith in Jesus.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **household of faith**. Look up household and faith in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated these words in another book of the Bible, use the same words that you have used there.

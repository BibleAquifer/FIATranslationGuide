Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 1:1–2 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

This passage begins a letter that Paul sent to Timothy. Remember that Paul is either in Macedonia or on his way there. Paul has left Timothy in Ephesus to take care of the community of believers and to confront people who teach wrong things. Timothy is most likely younger than many other believers who Timothy leads in Ephesus. Paul sent this letter to Timothy to encourage Timothy and to instruct him on how he should live and lead the other believers.

Stop here and look at a map of Macedonia and Ephesus as a group. Pause this audio here.

When Paul says he is an apostle, Paul reminds Timothy and the Ephesian believers that Paul has authority to teach them. Remember that an apostle is someone who God chose to be God's special messenger. Paul did not choose or decide for himself to be an apostle. God chose and ordered Paul to serve God for a special purpose. You will remember that before Paul became a believer, God directed Paul through Jesus, who spoke to Paul while Paul traveled on the road to Damascus. At that time, Paul did not believe in Jesus. Instead, Paul persecuted Jesus' people. Jesus told Paul to stop how he killed Jesus' people and instead to serve Jesus as Jesus' apostle. Here in this letter, Paul states that God gave Paul the work to preach and teach God's message and teachings. God's teachings are God's direction for how God's people should live and serve God.

Paul describes God as their savior because God is the one who saves people. When Paul calls God "our Savior," Paul reminds Timothy that God is the Savior of both Paul and Timothy, and also of all people who trust in God. Paul and Timothy have both spent time in Ephesus where they preached God's message of the gospel. Paul and Timothy have seen God save people when those people heard the message Paul preached. Paul's message was about Christ Jesus whom God sent into the world to die and come back to life to restore people to a right relationship with God. This is why Jesus is also called Christ, or "chosen one." When Paul describes Jesus as "our hope," Paul emphasizes what all believers look forward to because of Jesus. All believers can have hope, or confident expectation, that Jesus will save the believers from judgment and give them life forever with God in God's perfect kingdom. Paul will again remind Timothy about the hope he has because of Jesus later in this letter.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group. Give an example of someone who sends a message to someone else. How does the sender describe themselves? What would make the message have authority in the community? Pause this audio here.

As an apostle, Paul often sends letters to groups of believers to teach those believers about the gospel, instruct them how to live, or to encourage them. In fact, Paul had already sent a letter to the whole group of believers in the city of Ephesus to encourage those believers. In this letter, Paul talks specifically to Timothy, Paul's true son in the faith. Timothy is not Paul's son by birth. You will remember that Timothy spent a lot of time with Paul, to learn from Paul and help Paul in his ministry. Paul trusts Timothy, and Timothy is like a true, or real, son to Paul. Timothy and Paul are united by the faith, or trust, that they both have in Jesus.

Paul greets Timothy when he says, "Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord." Paul and others often greeted people in this way in their letters. Believers probably commonly greeted each other with the greeting "grace and peace." The believers wanted to remind each other about grace, which is God's undeserved kindness that God gives to his people. Believers also wanted to remind each other that God gives peace. The peace God gives his people is more than just an absence of disagreement and fighting. God's peace means that God blesses his people and makes them complete. God's people are content with each other and with God. Paul includes mercy in his greeting, even though Paul does not normally include it. When God shows mercy, God is kind, he forgives people for their disobedience, and does not treat people like they deserve. Paul wants to remind Timothy that God shows mercy because Paul wants to encourage Timothy as Timothy faces a difficult situation in Ephesus. This greeting is a common way to show goodwill, but it also encourages Timothy when it reminds him of the grace, mercy, and peace God gives Timothy through Christ Jesus.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 1:1–2 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has one part.

**In this part:** Paul says that Paul is an apostle, and he greets Timothy who is like a son to Paul.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* God
* Jesus Christ
* Someone who reads the letter out loud

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Paul now travels to Macedonia, or Paul may already be in Macedonia. Timothy is in a city called Ephesus. Paul sends this letter to Timothy.

Think about the passage as a letter from a father to a son. Remember that Paul and Timothy spent a lot of time together when they preached and taught the gospel message. Now Paul leaves Timothy in the city called Ephesus to take care of the believers there. Paul has left Ephesus and is on his way to a region called Macedonia. Ephesus is a busy city full of different kinds of people. Many people worship idols and believe many different kinds of teachings.

Paul is like a father to Timothy. Imagine how Paul works in Macedonia but thinks about Timothy who he has left in Ephesus to do something important. Paul gives Timothy instructions for Timothy's work to help Timothy and encourage him.

Paul usually begins his letters in the same kind of way every time: Paul states who he is, Paul says who the letter is for, and Paul greets the person or people. Paul uses the normal way to write letters at that time.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Give an example of an important message someone said or sent to someone else. How did the person say the message? What special words or phrases did the sender use to talk about themselves or the other person? Pause this audio here.

Paul probably spoke his message and someone else wrote it down. Then someone else took the letter to Timothy in Ephesus. Another person in Ephesus probably read the letter out loud to Timothy.

Paul begins the letter when he states that Paul is an apostle. Remember that Paul says that Paul is an apostle to remind the listeners that Paul has a special authority from God. Paul became an apostle because God and Christ Jesus chose Paul and told him to be an apostle. Paul includes Timothy and all the people who trust in Jesus when Paul says that God is our Savior and Christ Jesus is our hope. God is the savior for all believers. And all believers have hope because of what Jesus did for them.

Paul greets Timothy with a greeting that people would normally use at that time. But Paul says, "grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord." Paul chose these words as a greeting because they are especially related to the gospel that God called Paul and Timothy to preach. These words remind Timothy of what God gives Timothy because Timothy is God's child.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do you greet people in your community? What special words or phrases do you use to greet people? What greeting do you use when you send a message to someone you know? Give examples. Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Look again at the map that shows Macedonia and Ephesus. Draw or use objects to outline the land from the map on the floor, table, or piece of paper. On your map, put objects that represent Paul, Timothy, and the other believers on or near Ephesus. Then move Paul to Macedonia. Use another object to represent the writer of the letter and put that object in Macedonia. Use another object to represent the letter. Then use an object to represent the messenger who takes the letter to Timothy. Move that object to Ephesus and give the letter to Timothy.

Embodying the Text
------------------

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 1:1–2 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has one part.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* God
* Jesus Christ
* Someone who reads the letter out loud

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Set up the drama with a person who represents Paul. Have this person stand together with Timothy in one place. Act out how Paul tells Timothy to stay in Ephesus while Paul leaves and goes to another place.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel sad that Paul leaves; or
* I feel anxious about the work Paul wants me to do in Ephesus.

Choose another person to represent the person who writes down Paul's message to Timothy. The person who plays Paul then begins to speak the letter while the other person writes it down.

Paul says he is an apostle because God and Christ Jesus ordered Paul to be one. God is the savior, the one who saves people. Christ Jesus is the one who gives hope to all people who trust Jesus.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* Timothy needs to remember that Timothy cannot save people, but God can and does save people; or
* Timothy needs to remember that Timothy has hope because of what Christ Jesus did for people.

Paul says he sends the letter to Timothy, Paul's true son in the faith.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel love and affection for Timothy; or
* I miss Timothy like a father misses a son; or
* Timothy will continue my work for God one day, so I need to prepare Timothy.

Paul then greets Timothy when he says, "May God the father and our Lord Jesus Christ give you grace, mercy, and peace."

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 1:1–2 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul is an **apostle** because God and **Christ Jesus** chose and ordered Paul to be an apostle.

An apostle is someone Jesus chose to speak and teach Jesus' message. Apostles are people who can confirm to other people that Jesus really came back to life. Jesus gave apostles the special work to preach the gospel and to establish churches. Apostles are the representatives of Jesus in the church.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **apostle**. Look up apostle in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul describes God as our **Savior**. A savior is someone who rescues or delivers people from evil or danger.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **savior**. Look up savior in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul also describes **Christ** Jesus as our hope. Christ is the title for Jesus because Jesus is the Messiah, or the king and savior that God promised to the world. Christ and Messiah are two words that mean the same thing. Here, Paul uses Christ as part of Jesus' name.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **Christ**. Look up Christ in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

When Paul talks about **hope**, Paul does not mean to wish for something. Paul talks about hope like a person confidently expects that something will happen in the future. Sometimes, like in this letter, Paul says Jesus is hope because what Jesus did gives believers hope or causes believers to expect that Jesus will save them. A person who hopes in Jesus trusts and knows without any doubt that Jesus will do everything Jesus promises. It is important not to translate hope here as to simply wish for something.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **hope**. Look up hope in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, discuss that word to see if you can use it here. Pause this audio here.

Paul sent this letter to Timothy, Paul's true son in the **faith**. A person has faith when they trust someone and believe what that person says. Here, Paul talks about the faith, or trust, that both Paul and Timothy have in Jesus.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **faith**. Look up faith in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul then greets Timothy and says, "May God the father and our Lord Jesus Christ give you grace, mercy, and peace."

A **Lord** is someone who has authority over other people and deserves honor and respect. People often call Jesus, "Lord," because Jesus has full authority and deserves honor. Jesus is both God and king over his people.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **Lord**. Look up lord in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

**Grace** here refers to God's kindness that he shows when he gives good gifts to God's people even though they do not deserve those gifts.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **grace**. Before you discuss the word, look up grace in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

**Mercy** here refers to God's compassion or kindness. God shows his people compassion, or how God is kind, when he forgives those peoples' sins and saves them through Jesus.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **mercy**. Before you discuss the word, look up mercy in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Grace and mercy are similar words, but it is important that you use two different words in your translation, one for grace and one for mercy.

**Peace** refers to the absence of war and conflict but also to the fullness of life that comes because God blesses us.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **peace**. Before you discuss the word, look up peace in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 1:3–7 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

Remember that this passage is part of a letter that Paul sent to Timothy. Even though Paul is in a different place than Timothy, Paul still thinks about Timothy and the believers in Ephesus. Because Paul cannot be in Ephesus, Paul strongly asks, or urges, Timothy to stay in Ephesus to teach and guide the believers there.

Paul had strongly asked, or urged, Timothy to stay in Ephesus once before, while Paul was on his way to Macedonia. Now in his letter, Paul reminds Timothy that he left Timothy in Ephesus because Paul has work for Timothy to do. There is a problem among the believers in Ephesus. Some people there in Ephesus teach something different than Paul and Timothy teach. These people devote a lot of attention and energy to myths, or old stories, and long lists of ancestors. These people replace the message about Jesus with messages about things that are bad, and not true.

Myths are traditional stories about ancestors or the beginning of the world. Myths are either not fully true or not true at all. Some people in Ephesus pay attention to these stories so much that they replace the message of the good news about Jesus. Paul tells Timothy that Timothy's job is to tell these people to stop focusing on these stories and lists of ancestors.

Stop here and discuss as a group: Tell a traditional story from your culture. How do you know this story? Do people in your community think this story is a true story? Pause this audio here.

What the false teachers do causes people to argue about worthless things instead of to follow God's plan for his people. The false teachers do not focus on God's plan. God's plan in this case could be that believers do God's work, or that God has a plan to save people. In either case, these teachers do not teach the gospel message, but something different. These teachers do not support and build up God's people to act in love and peace with each other like God wants his people to act. Instead, these teachers cause people to argue and live in chaos.

Imagine that God's people are like a family who live in a house. God has taught his family the truth and how they should live in a way that pleases God. People can only know God and be in a right relationship with God by faith, which is to believe and trust in God. The people who teach wrong things reject what God has taught them. Then these people act in a way that does not please God. These people teach in a way that does not focus on God and the message from God that Paul had taught them. Timothy must tell these people who teach wrong things to stop what they do.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What do traditional stories in your community tell you about the way the world works? What would happen if people started to believe the story was true? Pause this audio here.

Paul reminds Timothy of why Timothy teaches believers. Timothy teaches believers in order to encourage people to love God and love one another rather than to argue with one another. Paul says love that pleases God comes from people who have a pure heart. A pure heart means these people do not have any bad motives. This love also comes from people who have a good conscience, which means these people know what is right and wrong. And this love comes from people who have genuine faith, which means these people really believe that what God says is true. Paul and Timothy are not like the false teachers, because Paul and Timothy teach what is right and true. Paul and Timothy's teaching comes from God, and this true teaching produces good things in people.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story or give an example of a time when what someone believed was true made them behave a certain way. How did what the person believed affect the way the person lived? How did the person change after they began to believe this? Pause this audio here.

Paul reminds Timothy that he must teach people the truth, because the people who give a different teaching have wandered, or walked away, from this love. These people's hearts are bad, and they do not pay attention to the things that God says are true and good. These people's useless teachings do not help the teachers or the people they teach to have good hearts and genuinely trust God.

These false teachers do not want to help believers love and trust God more and more. Instead, the false teachers want to become important people who can teach the law that God gave Moses for God's people to obey. But these false teachers do not understand what they talk about even though the false teachers are confident that the things they say are true.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Give an example or tell a story about someone who wanted to teach other people what to do or how to live. How do people become teachers in your community? What gives them the authority to teach?

Defining the Scenes

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 1:3–7 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul reminds Timothy why Paul left Timothy in Ephesus. Paul reminds Timothy to command some people to stop teaching wrong things. The things these people teach cause people to argue about things that are worthless.

**In the second part:** Paul tells Timothy that the goal of Timothy's teaching is love. This love comes when someone has a good heart and knows the difference between right actions and wrong actions. This love can only come when someone genuinely trusts God. Paul and Timothy's teachings cause people to have this kind of love because what they teach comes from God who always says what is good and true.

**In the third part:** Paul returns to talk about the people who teach wrong things. Paul reminds Timothy again that these people teach lies and cause bad things in the community.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* God
* Believers in Ephesus
* Someone who reads the letter out loud
* People who teach wrong things

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Paul travels on his way to Macedonia, or Paul may already be in Macedonia. Timothy is in a city called Ephesus, where Timothy is with other believers. Some people among the Ephesians teach wrong things.

In this passage, Paul tells Timothy to tell some people to stop teaching a different message about God's good news. Paul reminds Timothy of Timothy's goal when Timothy gives these people this instruction. These bad teachers must stop what they do because they do not truly know what they talk about and teach.

Paul reminds Timothy of instructions that Paul had already given to Timothy before Paul went to Macedonia. Paul says that what Paul will instruct Timothy to do now is just like what Paul told Timothy to do before Paul left to go to Macedonia. Paul does this to emphasize Paul's instructions to Timothy. This is the second time Paul encourages Timothy to do this work in Ephesus.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story where you begin by reminding someone of something you said to them before. How did you start the story? Pause this audio here.

Paul reminds Timothy that Paul left Timothy in Ephesus so that Timothy can tell some people to stop teaching a different teaching. These people must also stop spending all their time on old stories and long lists of ancestors, because these things lead them to teach wrong things. Paul explains that what these people do causes the Ephesians to argue about useless things that do not help the Ephesians behave in a way God wants them to behave.

Paul then emphasizes a contrast between what is bad and what is good. What some people do causes what is bad instead of what is good. God has planned things, and God's way to do things is good. To describe God's way to do things, Paul uses a word that people would commonly use to describe how someone stewards, or manages, a household or family. In Paul's day, a household included not just the family but also the people who worked for the family or for their farm or business. A family needed someone to steward the household so that everything would work well together. Paul uses this word to describe how God stewards God's people. God's church is like a household, or family, that God himself manages. God has also told his people how those people should live and work together like a family. God's family follows the way God stewards them by faith. In other words, God's family believes God and trusts in God and the way God directs their lives. But these bad teachers lead people away from God's plan and the order God has for his people.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Who makes the rules in your families and who manages the families? How do you describe that person and what that person does to direct or manage the family? Pause this audio here.

Paul then stops talking about the people who teach wrong things. Instead, Paul now talks about himself and Timothy. Paul contrasts the people who teach wrong things with Timothy, who has the same goal, or purpose, that Paul has. Paul and Timothy's purpose is to teach and care for the believers in the way that results in love. This love can only come from a pure or good heart, a good conscience, and a genuine faith. Paul and Timothy's purpose is for people to have this kind of love.

Paul then goes back to talk about the people who teach wrong things. The goal of the people who teach wrong things is to be teachers of the law of Moses. These people have wandered away from, or no longer teach, the good teaching that produces good things in people. Timothy must not allow these people to continue to teach, because these people do not understand two important things. First, these people do not understand the things they say, and second, these people do not understand that the things they are confident are true are really not true. These two things are similar to emphasize that these people cannot be teachers of the law because these people do not truly understand the law or the gospel message.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Draw or use objects to show how the believers, the people who teach wrong things, and Timothy are together in one place. This can be Ephesus. Think about this place like a house where God's family lives. Now mark another place as the place that is bad. Move the wrong teachers with some of the objects that are the good people out of the place that is God's house and put them into this new bad place. Think about this place as the bad house where people argue about things that do not help them understand the gospel or God's teaching.

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 1:3–7 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* God
* Believers in Ephesus
* Someone who reads the letter out loud
* People who teach wrong things

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

In this passage, Paul tells Timothy to tell some people to stop teaching a different gospel message. Paul reminds Timothy of Timothy's goal to give these people this instruction. These bad teachers must stop what they do because these teachers do not truly know what they talk about and teach.

You can divide your space into two sections: One section where Timothy and Paul can stand, and one section where the people who teach wrong things can stand. Timothy and Paul's section can represent the good teaching and good goal that comes from God. The other section can represent the bad teaching and selfish goal that is against God.

Paul faces Timothy and reminds Timothy, as Paul told Timothy before, that Paul left Timothy in Ephesus to tell some people to stop teaching a different message. These people must also stop spending all their time on myths, or old stories, and long lists of ancestors. These things lead these people to teach wrong things. Paul explains that what these people do causes the Ephesians to argue about useless things. Some of the Ephesian believers can go stand with the people who teach wrong things. This group of people argue among themselves.

What these people do causes what is bad rather than, or instead of, what is good. What is good is God's way to do things according to God's plan and order. The people who stand with Paul and Timothy do not argue. These people are peaceful and loving.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you thinking or feeling? Why are you telling this to Timothy?" The person might answer things like:

* Timothy must stop these bad teachers because what they teach is not from God; or
* I need to encourage Timothy that part of his work to take care of God's people is to correct these wrong teachings.

Paul reminds Timothy that the goal of Paul and Timothy's teaching is that people would love God and other people. This kind of love comes when people have a pure heart, a good conscience, and a genuine faith.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Timothy, "What are you thinking or feeling? Why do you think Paul tells you these things?" The person might answer things like:

* To remind me that my purpose is different from these people who teach wrong things. My purpose when I correct these people who teach wrongs is to encourage God's people to love; or
* I must correct these people who teach wrong things because what these people teach does not lead to a pure heart, a good conscience, and genuine faith. If I do not correct these people, these people will lead other people away from God and these things; or
* I need to keep my goal in mind when I correct these people. I need to show love.

But the goal of the people who teach wrong things is to be teachers of the law of Moses. These people have wandered away, or left the good teaching that produces good things in people. These people do not understand what they say and they do not understand the things they confidently teach.

The people who teach wrong things can act out teaching the people who stand with them about God's laws and what the people should and should not do.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you thinking or feeling? Why are you concerned about what these people do? Why is it important that Timothy tell these people to stop what they are doing?" The person might answer things like:

* These people are proud and want to be important teachers who tell people what to do. But these people do not care about what God says or understand God's law; or
* These people influence other people in a bad way. The things these people do and teach do not please God, and these people do not care about serving God; or
* The reason these people teach wrong things is only to serve themselves. These people do not care about what they do to the people they teach.

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 1:3–7 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul says that just like he strongly asked Timothy before, Paul now urges Timothy again to stay in Ephesus so that Timothy can demand, or command, some people to stop teaching a different message, or doctrine. Paul urges Timothy to also command these people to stop paying attention to myths and genealogies.

**Doctrine** is all the teachings, or statements, that someone teaches or accepts and believes. Here in this passage, when Paul says "a different doctrine," Paul talks about teachings that are different from what Jesus taught and are therefore wrong and bad.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **doctrine**. Look up doctrine in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

**Myths** are traditional stories about ancestors or about the beginning of the world. These stories may teach people something about the world, or about an important truth, but the stories themselves did not really happen.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **myth**. Pause this audio here.

**Genealogies** are lists of names of a family, tribe, or nation. Genealogies may also introduce the story of a person. Genealogies in the Bible are usually lists of Jewish people. Here, we do not know if the list of ancestors are Jewish people or other people.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **genealogies**. Look up genealogy in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul explains that what these people do causes the Ephesians to argue about useless things instead of to support what is good. What is good is God's way to do things according to how God has planned it and ordered it.

Paul stops talking about these other people to remind Timothy of his goal, or purpose, when he rebukes these people who teach wrong things. Paul and Timothy's goal is love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience and genuine faith.

**Pure** means not mixed. A pure heart is a heart that is only good, with no bad thing mixed with it. In the Bible, a pure heart often refers to someone whom God saves and makes good through Jesus.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **pure heart**. Look up pure in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

All people have **consciences**. A person's conscience is their sense, or ability to know, what is right or wrong. A conscience is like a part of a person's mind or heart, but we cannot see it. A conscience directs a person about what is right and wrong. A person can have a good conscience or an evil conscience. A good conscience leads a person to act well and do what is good. In the Bible, a good conscience leads people to obey God and gives those people a sense of satisfaction and well\-being. If someone with a good conscience disobeys God, that person feels a sense of shame and guilt.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **conscience**. Look up conscience in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

To have **faith** means to believe that what a person says about himself is true and to trust that person. If you believe in someone or have faith, you believe that what that person says about himself is true. If you have faith in God, you believe what God says about himself and the world and you trust that God will do what he promises to do.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **faith**. Look up faith in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

These people do not want to be like Paul and Timothy. Instead, these people want to be teachers of the law. But Paul warns Timothy that these people do not know anything about the things they talk about and say with so much confidence.

People who were **teachers of the law** explained the Scriptures to the people. These people did not write down their explanations. Instead, these people told the explanations to their students. The students memorized these explanations, and then taught the explanations to the next generation. People kept adding more and more explanations and discussions about explanations. In the time of the New Testament, these memorized explanations had become very important to the people, maybe even more important than the Scriptures themselves.

In the Bible, when people talk about the **law**, they mean the set of instructions that God has given the people of Israel. God gave the Israelites his laws through a man named Moses. Therefore, people often say the "law of Moses" when they mean the law that God gave the people through Moses.

When you translate "teachers of the law," you should not use a phrase that makes your listeners think that these people teach the law of a country. Maybe you can use a phrase like "teachers of the religious law," "experts of the religious law," or "experts of the Scriptures."

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **teachers of the law**. Look up teachers of the law in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

In this step, hear 1 Timothy 1:8–11 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

Paul has given Timothy instructions about the work Paul wants Timothy to do in the church in Ephesus. In the previous section, Paul reminded Timothy that some people in the church have taught wrong things. These people want others to call them teachers of the law of Moses, but Paul reminds Timothy that these people do not know anything about the law of Moses.

Now, Paul reminds Timothy that the law is good. Paul is talking about the law that God gave Moses. Paul says the law is good because it teaches us to do good things. Paul emphasizes that the people who have taught wrong things in the church use the law of Moses in the wrong way, but the law itself is good, because God gave the law to God's people. The false teachers try to teach people laws that God did not command. Paul says that the law of Moses is for people who do wrong things. When people believe in Jesus, God makes these people right in God's eyes, so these people want to do right things. Paul says that the law teaches us to do good things, and the good news about Jesus also teaches us to do these same good things.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story of a time when some people brought new ideas to your community that were different from your traditions. What was it like? Were people confused or angry? How did the community leaders handle that situation? Pause this audio here.

Paul now gives a list of people who break the law and sin in many different ways. Paul says the law is for these people. The wrong things in this list are not the only sins, but they are very strong examples of the kinds of wrong things that people do.

Paul talks about people who break the law and disobey. These are people who ignore or reject God's law.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what happens when a young person refuses to obey their father or chief? Pause this audio here.

Next, Paul talks about a group of people who act like they do not have any respect for God. Paul also says these people continue to do wrong things even if they know these things are wrong.

Paul mentions another group who are very similar. These people do things that do not please God. These people behave wickedly as if God is not important. Paul says that they are people who do not respect God. These people only care about things in this world.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story or a proverb about a person who continually does wrong things. Share this story or proverb with the group. Pause this audio here.

Now Paul gives other examples of bad things that people should not do. Paul talks about people who kill their father or their mother. Paul talks about murderers, or people who kill any other person. Then Paul talks about another group of people who do taboo or evil things. These people are sexually immoral in various different ways. Then Paul mentions a specific kind of sexual sin. These are men who sleep with other men.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about people who do these kinds of things. Pause this audio here.

Now Paul mentions slave traders. These are people who capture other people and then sell those people as slaves.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Can you tell a story or a legend about a time when your people captured slaves, or when other people captured slaves from your place? Pause this audio here.

Paul now talks about people who tell lies in two different ways. In the first group, imagine a person who had to go to a judge or a ruler. Imagine how that person had to swear to tell the truth, but then that person lied. After that Paul talks about liars in general, or people who say things that they know are not true.

Finally, Paul finishes his list with a general statement that includes all other bad things that do not please God. Paul reminds Timothy that right teaching about the good news of Jesus forbids us to do these things. Paul praises God for God's wonderful good news, and Paul reminds Timothy that God gave Paul the job to tell the good news to others.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

In this step, hear 1 Timothy 1:8–11 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul says that the law is good when people teach the law the right way.

**In the second part:** Paul lists different groups of people who do wrong things that are opposite to God's law and to the good news about Jesus.

**In the third part:** Paul praises God for the wonderful good news about Jesus.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* God
* The believers who listen to these words
* The person who reads this letter aloud
* People who teach wrong things about the law
* People who break the law and sin in different ways

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Think about the passage as a whole. Paul talks about two good things—the law and the good news about Jesus. Paul says that the law teaches us to do good things, and the good news about Jesus also teaches us to do these same good things. Paul talks about the law in the first part of the passage. Paul talks about the good news in the third part of the passage. In between these two good things, Paul talks about a list of people who do very bad things. Paul's ideas move from good—the law—to bad—people doing very bad things—back to good—the good news about Jesus. These movements may help the people in the group to visualize the flow of the passage.

Paul begins the first part of the passage when he responds to the end of the previous section. In that section Paul talks about people who teach wrong things, but who want others to think that those people teach the law of Moses. When Paul says, "Now we know," Paul emphasizes a contrast between the people who teach wrong things and Paul's right teaching.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: When you tell a story and you want to start talking about a new part that is very different from the last part, what do you say? Pause this audio here.

Paul continues his idea when he says "understanding this." Paul wants the people in Ephesus to clearly understand the reasons why God gave the law. Paul says that God gave the law of Moses because people are sinful and do wrong things. When people believe in Jesus, God makes those people want to do the right things. So once people follow Jesus, those people do not need the law in the same way.

Now Paul begins the long list of people who break the law and sin in many different ways. Paul emphasizes that these people are the ones who need the law. Paul makes the list mostly in pairs, with two similar ideas side by side. Paul organizes the list in this way to make it easy to remember. The wrong things in this list are not the only sins, but these things are very strong examples of the kinds of wrong things that people do.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: When you tell a story to teach young people things that are important in your culture, how do you say the important things so that they are strong and easy to remember? Pause this audio here.

Think about the wrong things in pairs, with two similar ideas side by side:

* Paul talks about people who break the law and disobey.
* Then Paul talks about people who do not respect God, and people who continue to do wrong things even if they know those things are wrong.
* Next Paul talks about those who behave wickedly and only care about things in this world.
* Then Paul talks about those who kill their father or mother, and those who kill anyone else.
* Next Paul talks about people who are sexually immoral, and men who sleep with other men.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: You may remember that in the previous step you told a story about someone who did wrong things sexually. When you told that story, how did you discuss things that are taboo or difficult in your culture in a way that is acceptable? Pause this audio here.

Paul continues his list when he talks about slave traders. This is the only thing on the list that is alone. Paul then goes on to talk about people who tell lies to their judges or leaders, and those who tell lies more generally. Paul finishes his list when he talks about any wrong thing that is opposed to the good news.

Finally, Paul moves back to the good news. Paul talks about the good news very joyfully and strongly, and Paul praises God for the glory of the good news. Paul thanks God that God gave Paul the job to tell the good news to others.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: When you tell a story, how do you emphasize the best and most exciting part? Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. As you do this, you might want to have drawings or objects to represent Paul, Timothy, the church in Ephesus, the people who taught wrong things, the lawbreakers, and the believers. As you begin to retell the story of these verses, remember that Paul's ideas move from good—the law when used in the right way—to bad—people doing very bad things—back to good—the good news about Jesus. These movements may help the people in the group to visualize the flow of the passage.

In this step, hear 1 Timothy 1:8–11 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* God
* The believers who listen to these words
* The person who reads this letter aloud
* People who teach wrong things about the law
* People who break the law and sin in different ways

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

In this passage, Paul talks about two good things—the law and the good news about Jesus. Paul says that the law teaches us to do good things, and the good news about Jesus also teaches us to do these same good things. Paul talks about the law in the first part of the passage. Paul talks about the good news in the third part of the passage. In between these two good things, Paul talks about a list of people who do very bad things. You might want to divide the room in two sections: the good side and the bad side. When you talk about the law, you can stand on the good side. When you talk about the list of people who do very bad things, you can move to the bad side. Finally, when you talk about the good news, you can return to the good side. These movements may help the people in the group to experience the flow of the passage.

Starting on the good side of the room, the person who plays Paul can tell Timothy and the believers who listen to the message about how we know that the law is good if it is used in a good way. Paul says, "People who are righteous do not need to be controlled by the law. It is not for them."

Then Paul can move to the bad side of the room and talk about the different kinds of lawbreakers and sinners. Paul says, "These are the people who need the law."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel relieved that I do not have to worry about the law anymore.

Paul then talks about people who are godless and sinners. Paul also talks about those who are unholy or profane.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking about these sinners?" The person might answer things like:

* These are terrible sins; or
* It is really frustrating to be a good pastor when these kinds of people are around. These people do not care about the things I tell them about God.

Paul then talks about people who are murderers, who even kill their parents, or who do sexual sins.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the believers, "What are you feeling or thinking about these sinners?" The person might say things like:

* These are very shameful things that are hard to talk about.

Paul then talks about slave traders and deceitful people.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays God, "What are you feeling or thinking about these sinners?" The person might say things like:

* These sins are the opposite of who I am. These sins break my heart and make me sad.

Finally, Paul can move back to the good side, and say, "All of those bad things, and anything like them, are opposed to the wonderful good news. I bless God, because the great, good news is that he has set us free from all of that! And God has given me the job of telling everyone about it!"

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the false teachers, "What are you feeling or thinking about this good news?" The person might say things like:

* I never really understood the good news before.

In this step, hear 1 Timothy 1:8–11 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul tells Timothy that the **law** is good. When Paul talks about the law, Paul means the set of instructions that God gave to Moses long ago, so that the people of Israel would know how to live in a way that pleases God. Paul says that the law itself is good, even though some people in the church in Ephesus have taught wrong things about the law.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **law**. Look up law in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same words that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul says that God did not give the law to correct people who are **righteous**. When people believe in Jesus, God makes those people righteous, or right in God's eyes, so that those people want to do the right things and have a good relationship with God.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **righteousness**. Look up righteousness in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same words that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul now gives a list of people who break the law and sin in many different ways. First, Paul talks about people who break the law and disobey. **Lawbreakers** are people who ignore or reject laws. In this case Paul is talking about God's law specifically. **Rebels** are people who resist or reject authority in general.

Stop here and discuss what words or phrases you will use for **lawbreakers** and **rebels**. Pause this audio here.

Next, Paul talks about a group of people who are **ungodly** or godless. These people act like they do not have any respect for God. Paul also talks about **sinners**. These are people who continue to do wrong things even if they know they are wrong.

Stop here and discuss what words or phrases you will use for **ungodly** and **sinners**. These words are very similar to each other. In some languages it may be necessary to combine these words. Look up sin and ungodly in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated these words in another book of the Bible, use the same words that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul mentions two more groups who are very similar. The first group are those who are **unholy**, people who do things that do not please God. These people behave wickedly as if God is not important. Paul says that the second group are **profane**, people who do not respect God. These people only care about things in this world.

Stop here and discuss what words or phrases you will use for **unholy** and **profane**. Look up profane in the Master Glossary for more information. These words are very similar to each other. In some languages it may be necessary to combine these words. Pause this audio here.

Now Paul talks about **people who kill their father or their mother**. Then Paul talks about **murderers**, people who kill any other person.

Stop here and discuss what words or phrases you will use for killing and murder. Pause this audio here.

Paul now talks about people who are sexually **immoral**. This talks about any time people have sexual relations outside of marriage between a man and a woman. Then Paul mentions a specific kind of sexual sin, **homosexuality**. These are men who have sexual relations with other men.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **sexual immorality**. Look up immorality in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same words that you have used there. Discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **homosexuality**. Pause this audio here.

Now Paul mentions **slave traders** or kidnappers. These are people who capture other people and then sell those people as slaves.

Stop here and discuss what words or phrases you will use for **slave traders**. Look up slave in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have translated these words in another book of the Bible, use the same words that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Next Paul talks about two different ways that people tell lies. First Paul talks about liars in general, people who say things that those people know are not true. The second group are **perjurers**. These are people who swore an oath to tell the truth before a judge or a ruler, but then lied to the judge or ruler.

Stop here and discuss what words or phrases you will use for **liars** and **perjurers**. Pause this audio here.

Finally, Paul finishes his list with a general statement that includes all other bad things that do not please God. Paul reminds Timothy that right teaching, or right **doctrine**, is about the **good news** of Jesus, which forbids us to do these things. Use the same word for doctrine that you used in previous passages, and look up doctrine in the Master Glossary for more information.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for "good news" and "right doctrine" or right teaching. Look up good news and doctrine in the Master Glossary for more information. Since you have already translated these words in another book of the Bible, use the same words that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul closes this section by saying that God's good news is **glorious**, full of **glory**.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **glorious** or **glory**. Look up glory in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same words that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul says another thing about God. Paul says God is **blessed**. Paul is praising God and thanking God for God's goodness.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **bless**. Look up bless in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same words that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Finally Paul says that God gave Paul the job to tell this glorious good news to others.

Setting the Stage

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 1:12–20 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this passage, Paul is thankful for God's mercy and how God called Paul to serve God. Paul also reminds Timothy to continue to trust God and do what Timothy knows is right.

Stop here and share a story about a mentor in your community who guided a younger person in a leadership role. Pause this audio here.

Paul begins when he thanks Christ Jesus directly. Paul thanks Jesus for making Paul strong, for trusting that Paul is faithful to Jesus, and for appointing Paul to serve Jesus.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do people in your community show their thanks for important opportunities the leaders have given them? Pause this audio here.

Paul remembers his past. Paul describes himself as a man who insulted God and persecuted believers. You will remember that before Paul became a believer, Paul persecuted members of the church. Paul says God gave Paul mercy, or treated Paul kindly, because Paul had done these things before Paul understood or trusted in Jesus.

Stop here and share a story about someone in your community who changed their beliefs or actions in a big way. How did other people respond to how this person changed? Pause this audio here.

Paul shows how God's grace powerfully changes even people who do the worst things. Paul looks back at Paul's own story as proof of how merciful and gracious God is to sinners. Because Paul himself experienced such incredible mercy, Paul can say with confidence that this is an absolutely true saying: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. Paul knows this deep in Paul's heart because Paul remembers how Paul used to be someone who actively fought against Jesus and hurt Jesus' followers. Yet God showed Paul mercy anyway. Paul realizes that if God could forgive and transform someone like Paul, then God's grace can change anyone.

Stop here and discuss these questions as a group: Tell a story about someone in your community who did wrong but then changed their ways. What did they do? How did people treat that person before and after the person changed? Has a leader in your community ever admitted they were wrong about something? What happened after the leader admitted this? How did people respond to the leader? Pause this audio here.

Paul explains that his experience of receiving mercy is an example for others who would believe and receive eternal life. God can use even our past mistakes and sins as a way to show that God forgives and changes lives.

Stop here and share a story about someone in your community whose life change has inspired others to change also. Pause this audio here.

Then Paul praises God! Paul calls God "the King eternal," or the king who rules forever. Paul also calls God "immortal." This means God cannot die. This name shows that God is different from everything else because only God lives forever. Paul describes God as "invisible." This name means people cannot see God. Jewish teachers used this name when the teachers talked to people who believed in idols. The Jewish teachers wanted to show that God is not like statues that people can see and touch. Paul also calls God "the only God." Jewish people had an important prayer in which people stated that there is only one true God. This was also important because many people in Paul's time believed in many different gods. These names for God show how great and powerful God is. Paul wants Timothy and the church to join Paul in praising God.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do people in your culture show that they are very thankful to God, especially in religious contexts? Pause this audio here.

Paul then talks directly to Timothy. Paul reminds Timothy that people prophesied that Timothy would serve God. Later in this letter we will hear that church leaders prophesied, laid their hands on Timothy, and set Timothy apart for this work. Paul encourages Timothy to remember these prophecies and to fight the battle well. When Paul wrote about how Christians should live and serve God, Paul often described the Christians as soldiers who fight a battle. Just like a soldier keeps fighting in a battle, Timothy should never stop how he believes in Jesus, how he keeps a good conscience, and how he knows what is the right and wrong thing to do.

Stop here and share a story about how people in your community choose young leaders. Then discuss this question: How do leaders in your community continue to do what is right? How do leaders help people continue to trust the leaders? Pause this audio here.

Paul gives an example of two men named Hymenaeus and Alexander who rejected the true teaching from God. These men chose to follow different beliefs instead of Paul's gospel message. These men could no longer tell right from wrong, and the men rejected God. Paul says the men had a disaster in their faith. Paul compares this disaster to a ship that crashes and breaks apart in the sea.

Paul takes direct action against these men. Paul hands Hymenaeus and Alexander over to Satan. This means the church must treat these men like people who do not believe. The church removes these men from their community. This puts the men outside of God's protection and into the world where Satan has power. Paul wants Satan to teach these men not to speak against God. Paul hopes this severe process will help these men change. Paul wants these men to return to the true faith. This discipline is the last step to deal with people who will not admit they are wrong. The church uses this punishment only after the church tries other ways to correct wrong behavior.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How does your community handle situations where a leader has failed or behaved against the community's values? Pause this audio here.

This passage shows how God's kindness and forgiveness can change people, especially leaders. The passage also shows what can happen when leaders no longer do what is right and turn away from their faith.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 1:12–20 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then, the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul tells Christ Jesus that he is thankful Jesus appointed Paul to Jesus' service, despite Paul's former life as a blasphemer, persecutor, and violent man.

**In the second part:** Paul explains how Christ came into the world to save sinners. Paul was the worst of sinners. But Paul received mercy so he could show others an example of Christ's patience.

**In the third part:** Paul charges Timothy to fight the good fight and to keep faith and a good conscience. Paul also mentions two men who have shipwrecked or rejected their faith.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Christ Jesus our Lord
* Immortal, invisible, and only God
* Timothy
* Hymenaeus
* Alexander

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

This passage is part of a letter from Paul to Timothy. It is important to show that these are Paul's words to Timothy that Paul wrote to instruct and encourage Timothy.

Stop here and discuss how leaders write letters in which they instruct or encourage people in your culture. If you do not write letters, how else might a leader encourage someone he leads or teaches? How do you show that the teacher or leader gives important advice to someone they care about? Pause this audio here.

Paul begins when he gives strong thanks to Christ Jesus. Paul says that Paul used to be a "blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent." A blasphemer is someone who speaks against God or shows disrespect to God. Paul admits that Paul used to say terrible things about Jesus and God. A persecutor is someone who hurts or attacks others because of their beliefs. Paul hunted down Christians, Paul had leaders arrest Christians, and Paul approved when leaders killed Christians for their faith. An insolent opponent is someone who proudly and openly fights against something. Paul did not just disagree with Christians quietly. Paul was aggressive and cruel toward Christians. Paul was arrogant when Paul attacked the Christian faith. Paul uses strong words to show the dramatic change in Paul's life.

When Paul says he "acted ignorantly in unbelief," it means two things. First, Paul did not know the truth about Jesus. And second, Paul did not believe Jesus was really the Son of God. Paul thought that to attack Christians was the right thing to do. Paul was wrong, but Paul did not try to fight against God on purpose. This does not excuse Paul's actions, but it does explain why God showed Paul mercy. When God shows mercy, God does not give the punishment someone deserves. God showed mercy to Paul when God forgave Paul instead of punishing Paul for how Paul hurt Christians.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do people show they are truly thankful when someone forgives them for a serious mistake? What actions or changes in behavior show that the person is genuinely grateful? Pause this audio here.

When Paul talks about the grace of our Lord, Paul specifically talks about Jesus Christ. Paul uses the title Lord to show that Jesus is divine and has authority. This is the same Jesus whom Paul had once rejected and fought against.

When Paul describes how Jesus's grace, faith, and love pour out and overflow, Paul uses the picture of how something spills over the sides of a container. Think of a cup that someone pours so much water into that the water spills everywhere. This is how Paul describes Jesus's grace, faith, and love. Paul experienced Jesus' grace, trusted in or had faith in Jesus more, and experienced Jesus' love for Paul.

Stop here and discuss as a group: How do you talk about when someone is especially kind to you even when you do not deserve that kindness? How will you talk about how Jesus shows grace and love to Paul like water overflows a container? Pause this audio here.

Paul uses the phrase, "The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance" to introduce an important statement about Christ's purpose. This phrase shows that what follows is an important truth of the Christian faith.

Stop here and discuss as a group: How will you introduce the important statement that Christ Jesus came to save sinners? Pause this audio here.

Paul refers to himself as the "foremost" of sinners. When Paul calls himself the "foremost of sinners," Paul means two important things. First, Paul refers to how terrible Paul's sins were. Paul had attacked Christians and worked to destroy the church. These were huge sins against God and God's people. Paul uses "foremost" to show just how serious these sins were.

Second, Paul says this to make himself an example. Paul wants to show that if Jesus could save the worst enemy of the church, Jesus can save anyone. Paul becomes a pattern or model. When other people look at Paul's story, those people can see how patient and merciful Jesus is.

Paul does not mean that Paul sins more than everyone else in the world. Instead, Paul makes a point about Jesus's power to save. Paul was the Christians' biggest enemy, but now Paul is one of their greatest teachers. This huge change shows how completely Jesus can transform someone.

Paul tells his story for an important reason. Some teachers said people needed to follow strict rules in order for God to save them. But Paul's story shows something different. Paul's story shows that God saves people when those people believe in Jesus, not just when they follow rules. If Jesus could save Paul, who had done such terrible things, Jesus can save anyone who believes.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do people in your culture show that they are humble, especially when God or someone has given them an important position? How will you talk about how Paul calls himself the "foremost of sinners"? Pause this audio here.

After he shares his own story, Paul now turns back to Timothy with a personal tone. Paul even calls Timothy "my son" to show the close relationship between Paul and Timothy. Paul returns to the task he gave Timothy at the beginning of the letter. Earlier, Paul had told Timothy to stop the false teachers in Ephesus. Now, Paul reminds Timothy of this important job.

Paul connects this command to special prophecies that people made about Timothy in the past. The prophecies showed that God had chosen Timothy for this task.

Paul tells Timothy to "fight the good fight." This is a picture of Timothy as a soldier in a battle. The battle is not with real weapons. Instead, Timothy must fight to protect the true message about Jesus from false teachers. Paul wants Timothy to remember those prophecies about Timothy. The prophecies will give Timothy the courage and strength to do this difficult job.

By starting and ending with instructions to Timothy, Paul shows how important Timothy's work is. Paul's own story of how Paul changed from an enemy to a teacher helps show Timothy why it matters so much that Timothy stops false teachers.

The passage ends when Paul mentions two men, Hymenaeus and Alexander, who have "shipwrecked their faith." When Paul says these men "shipwrecked their faith," Paul means they have completely destroyed their spiritual journey. Just like a ship that crashes on rocks and breaks apart, these men destroyed their faith when they rejected the truth and taught false ideas. These men were important leaders in the church at Ephesus. Both men turned away from what Paul had taught them and started to teach false ideas instead.

Paul took strong action against these men. Paul had these men removed from the church community. Paul describes this as "handing them over to Satan." This means the men were outside the protection of the church. This was a serious form of church discipline.

But Paul's goal was not just to punish the men. Paul wanted these men to learn from their mistakes and to stop how they spoke against God's truth. Just as Paul himself had once spoken against God, but God showed Paul mercy, Paul hopes these men will change.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about someone you know who once followed strong beliefs or values but later turned away from those beliefs completely. Pay special attention to the words and phrases people in your community use to describe when someone abandons their beliefs. What images or special language do people use to explain what happened? Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. As you do this, you might want to have drawings or objects to represent how Paul completely changed, how Timothy received the letter, and how the people removed the two false teachers from the church community. You could show how Paul changes from an enemy to a teacher. Then you could show people how people lay hands on Timothy and appoint Timothy to lead. Show Timothy as he goes to a group of objects or people who represent the church in Ephesus. When you talk about Hymenaeus and Alexander, you can move their objects outside of the group of objects or people that represent the church. These objects can help show how Paul's personal story connects to his instructions for Timothy and the church.

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 1:12–20 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Christ Jesus our Lord
* Immortal, invisible, and only God
* Timothy
* Hymenaeus
* Alexander

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then, continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul begins when he thanks Christ Jesus for how Christ gives Paul strength, considers Paul faithful, and appoints Paul to service.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel overwhelmed with gratitude for Christ's mercy and trust in me; or
* I am amazed at how God has transformed my life. I was a persecutor, but now I am a servant.

Paul then describes his past as a blasphemer, persecutor, and violent man. Paul explains that he received mercy because Paul acted in ignorance and unbelief.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel deep remorse for my past actions, but I am also in awe of God's grace; or
* I am humbled because I realise that God's mercy reaches even someone like me.

Paul emphasizes the overflowing grace of God, along with faith and love in Christ Jesus. Paul states a trustworthy saying about how Christ came to save sinners, of whom Paul considers himself the worst.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel unworthy, yet I also feel a deep joy in Christ's power to save; or
* I am so happy that my story can serve as an example of God's perfect patience.

Paul expresses that the reason Paul received mercy was so that Christ Jesus might display his great patience as an example for others who would believe in Christ for eternal life. Paul then breaks into praise for the eternal King.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am filled with awe at God's grand plan and how God uses even my life to show his mercy; or
* I feel compelled to praise God for God's wisdom and glory.

Paul then addresses Timothy and reminds him of the prophecies people once made about Timothy. Paul encourages Timothy to hold on to faith and a good conscience.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel a fatherly concern for Timothy and want to encourage Timothy in his faith journey; or
* I remember how important it is to mentor and guide younger believers.

Finally, Paul mentions Hymenaeus and Alexander, who rejected faith and good conscience so that their faith wrecked like a ship. Paul states that he has handed these men over to Satan to teach them not to blaspheme.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel saddened by their departure from the faith, but I hope this discipline will bring them back; or
* I am concerned about the impact of false teaching on the church and feel a responsibility to address it.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 1:12–20 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul thanks **Christ** Jesus his Lord. Christ is a title that means "chosen one" or "anointed one." When Paul says "Christ Jesus," Paul means Jesus is the promised savior God had planned to send. This title shows Jesus is the one God chose to save people from their sins. Look up Christ in the Master Glossary for more information, and use the same word for Christ as you have used in previous passages.

The title **Lord** shows Jesus has full authority. When Paul calls Jesus Lord, Paul means Jesus is divine and rules over everything. This is especially powerful because Paul once denied that Jesus was Lord. Now Paul joyfully accepts Jesus as Paul's master and ruler. Translate Lord in the same way you have in previous passages, and look up Lord in the Master Glossary for more information.

Paul describes how he was a **blasphemer**, **persecutor**, and **insolent opponent**. These terms describe Paul's actions against Christ and the church before Paul's conversion. Blasphemer refers to someone who speaks against or insults God. A persecutor is someone who mistreats or harasses others because of their beliefs. An insolent opponent describes someone who aggressively opposes something in a disrespectful or arrogant manner.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **insolent opponent**, **blasphemer**, and **persecutor**. Look up blasphemy and persecution in the Master Glossary for more information. Pause this audio here.

Paul mentions how Paul received **mercy** from God. Mercy is when someone who has the power to punish chooses not to do so, and instead shows kindness. Use the same word for mercy as you have used in previous passages. Look up mercy in the Master Glossary for more information.

Paul says, "the **grace** of our Lord **overflowed** for me." Grace refers to God's undeserved kindness or favor. Use the same word for grace as you used in previous passages.

Look up grace in the Master Glossary for more information.

Paul also says that Jesus poured out his **faith** and **love** over Paul. Someone has faith when they trust or believe in Jesus. Paul sees this love as both a gift from God and proof that God's grace has truly changed Paul. It is not just warm feelings, but a complete transformation of how he relates to others. Paul went from causing harm to showing Christ's love. Use the same words for faith and love as you have used in previous passages, and look up faith in the Master Glossary for more information.

Paul describes how Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. The concept of **saving** in this context refers to rescuing from sin and its consequences. Use the same word for sinners as you used in previous passages, and look up sin in the Master Glossary for more information.

Stop here and discuss what word or phrase you will use for "saving sinners." Look up salvation and sin, if needed, in the Master Glossary for more information. Pause this audio here.

Paul says that he is an example for people who want to **believe** in Jesus and have **eternal life**. When people believe in Jesus, they believe that what Jesus says about himself is true, and those people trust and follow Jesus. Then those people have eternal life, or life with God that lasts forever.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **believe** and for **eternal life**. Look up belief and eternal life in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated these words in another book of the Bible, use the same words here. Pause this audio here.

Paul praises God and calls him the eternal **king**, or the king who lives forever. A king is someone who rules over a kingdom, or a specific territory. God is the king over the whole world, and all of creation is his kingdom.

Paul gives God honor and **glory**. This means that he respects God and admires God. Use the same word for glory that you used in previous passages. Look up glory in the Master Glossary for more information.

Paul mentions **prophecies** about Timothy. Prophecies were special messages from God. These prophecies about Timothy were like God's stamp of approval. The prophecies showed everyone that God had picked Timothy for this important work in the church.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **prophecies**. Look up prophecy in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

**Satan** is a spiritual being. Satan is God's enemy who works against God's people. When Paul talks about handing people over to Satan, Paul means to put those people outside the church's protection. This was a serious form of discipline. The goal was to help these people realize their mistakes and return to the truth.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 2:1–7 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

Paul began his letter to Timothy by telling Timothy that Paul knows there are people in the church in Ephesus who teach wrong things. These people's teachings go against God's law and the good news which God commanded Paul to teach. You will remember that in the passage before this one, Paul encouraged Timothy to stay strong in Timothy's responsibility to teach people this same good news.

In this section, Paul begins to give Timothy some specific instruction for the best ways to stop the bad teachers in Ephesus and to save the believers and himself from those teachers' wrong teachings. Paul's first instruction to Timothy is to have the people in Ephesus pray.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What does a prayer meeting look like in your community? What are the different ways you might ask a person to pray for you? Pause this audio here.

Paul encourages believers to pray for everyone, including people who have authority over the believers. Many people at this time believed that families with political power, like kings and queens, had power because those people's gods had given it to the people. As for the other political, military, and religious positions of power, rich people could pay to control the people in those positions. You will remember in Acts that Paul spent two years in Ephesus. Paul's teachings made both Jewish and Gentile leaders in Ephesus angry with Paul and the new believers. In that situation, the Gentiles were angry because if people no longer worshiped their local goddess, it would change their cultural practices of worship and hurt their businesses. The people of Ephesus also worshiped the human emperor in Rome as if the emperor were a god. So decisions about who to worship in Ephesus could also affect a person's life politically.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How does a person become a leader in your community? Tell examples from your lives when something you did or said to be obedient to God made leaders or other people in your community angry with you. How did you respond? Pause this audio here.

In response to these challenges, Paul tells Timothy to teach the believers to pray for the salvation of all people, including their political leaders. Paul says this kind of prayer will help the people to live in peace in their communities. Paul also says this will show that the believers are godly and dignified. In other words, it will show that the believers are people who live in a way that pleases God, and it will show the believers make good choices because they think carefully.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Discuss the kinds of things people do when they live in peace with others in your community and pray for others in the community. How do you describe people who live like this? Pause this audio here.

Paul then says that to pray like this is good before God. When Paul says "before God," Paul means that God sees this kind of prayer as a good thing. In other words, God likes it when we pray for others. Paul supports this when he explains that God wants to save all people and God wants all people to know the truth. Paul explains that God has saved us through Jesus. Paul describes Jesus as a mediator. A mediator is a person who helps two people in an argument to find a way to agree and make peace with each other.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell examples from your lives when you had a serious argument with someone. What did you and that person do to make peace with each other? Who has the special job in your community to help two people come to an official agreement? Pause this audio here.

Paul says that Jesus gave himself as a "ransom." Slavery was a common and acceptable practice in Paul and Timothy's time. When someone was a prisoner, or a slave, another person could buy and set that person free. People called the money that the person paid to free the slave or prisoner a ransom.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: If someone in your community has a debt that they cannot pay, how can that person find help to pay the debt? Do people think it is a good thing to pay a bill or fine for someone else? Tell a story of a time when someone paid the debt of someone else. Pause this audio here.

Paul ends this passage about prayer and salvation for all by reminding Timothy that, in fact, the mission that God gave Paul was to tell all people this message about Jesus. Paul says that his mission is to tell the Gentiles, which means people who are not Jews. Paul says that Paul is an apostle to the Gentiles. You will remember that Jesus sent apostles on missions to tell other people about the good news even before Jesus' death and resurrection. Here, Paul strongly insists that Paul also has a special mission from God to go and tell all people about Jesus.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about someone who is on a special mission. Pay attention to how you talk about who sent that person on the mission, and also how you talk about if the person did a good job or a bad job completing the mission.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 2:1–7 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul urges the believers to pray for everyone. Paul also says to pray for kings and people who have authority. Paul says this will help the believers live in peace and godliness with their community.

**In the second part:** Paul says that God likes it when believers do this because God wants to save all people. Paul explains that God saves people through Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the only mediator who makes peace between God and people. Jesus did this when he gave himself as a ransom for our freedom.

**In the third part:** Paul says that God has sent Paul to teach the Gentiles this message about Jesus.

The characters in this passage are:

* The believers in Ephesus
* All human beings
* People in positions of authority
* God
* Christ Jesus
* Paul
* Gentiles

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Paul has said in previous passages that Paul knows there are problems in the church in Ephesus. As Paul begins, Paul connects this passage to the previous one with a phrase that strongly urges Timothy to follow Paul's advice in this and the next passages. In this way, Timothy can stop the bad teachers and save himself and the believers in Ephesus from these people's wrong teachings. Prayer is the first of many instructions Paul gives Timothy in his letter. Paul talks about prayer first to show that prayer is the most important thing believers can do.

Paul says the believers should pray in four ways. The believers should make requests, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings. When someone makes intercession, that person makes a request for someone else. Paul talks about these four ways to pray to show that Paul wants the believers to pray all kinds of prayers. The whole idea means, "Pray every kind of prayer for everyone."

Paul encourages the believers to pray for everyone, including kings and the other leaders who have authority over the believers. Paul tells Timothy that the result or goal of prayer is that believers will live peaceful and quiet lives in their communities, and that when the believers pray, the believers will show that they are godly and dignified people. The words peaceful and quiet are very similar here. These words both mean to be calm and orderly. When people are godly, those people live life in a way that pleases God and shows respect for God. When people are dignified, those people live in a way that shows they make good decisions that make other people respect them. All of these qualities together describe the kind of life that the believers should live. When believers live this way, the believers' relationship with their community is better, and that community views Christians and God better.

Stop here and discuss as a group times when you gave advice to someone about how to live a good life or how to act well in a difficult situation. Pay attention to how you showed which things to do were more important than others. Discuss what will happen when someone lives life in this way. Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul supports Paul's instructions when he says that God likes it when believers pray like this, because God wants to save everyone. Paul says that Jesus is the one mediator and that Jesus paid for our freedom with himself as the ransom. Paul then describes what Jesus did as a testimony, or message, that came at the best time it could have come.

Stop here and discuss as a group a time when you received a message at just the right time when you needed it. Pay attention to how you express when the message came and why that time was a good time for you to have heard the message. Pause this audio here.

In the third part of this passage, Paul connects his instruction to pray for the salvation of all people to Paul's own mission to tell all people about the good news. The good news about Jesus is not just for Jews. Paul says that God made Paul a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher so that Paul could tell this testimony about Jesus to Gentiles also. In other words, God has sent Paul to teach all people—including the non\-Jewish people—in faith and in truth the things that Paul knows about Jesus. When Paul says that he teaches in faith and in truth, some people think Paul talks about the way Paul teaches. In other words, Paul teaches the Gentiles faithfully and truthfully—always teaching them the truth. Other people think Paul wants to describe the thing that Paul teaches. In other words, Paul teaches the message of faith, or trusting in Jesus. He also teaches truth, or the true things of God. Paul wants Timothy to know without doubt that Paul tells the truth about himself. Paul even interrupts what he writes to insist that when Paul says he is an apostle, Paul tells the truth.

Stop here and discuss things about yourself that you are very sure are true. Pay attention to how you insist that these things are true. Do you interrupt yourself? How will you translate that Paul interrupts himself and insists that these things are true about Paul? Translate Paul's insistence in the most natural way in your language, even if that means you need to change the order of the passage. Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Use objects or drawings to show how Paul tells Timothy to encourage the believers to pray. In another area, you can place believers and people in authority in two groups. Show how Timothy tells the believers what Paul has instructed the believers to do. Timothy and the believers should show that they pray for the leaders. Jesus can stand between the believers, God, and the leaders. Maybe Jesus could walk to God with some of the leaders, and then bring the leaders into the community of the believers. This shows that Jesus is the mediator, the one who brings people into God's community of believers. Show that the people in the community of unbelievers respect the believers. Show how God and Jesus watch the believers and are pleased with what the believers do. Show how Paul teaches the community of unbelievers and the leaders about Jesus.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* The believers in Ephesus
* All human beings
* People in positions of authority
* God
* Christ Jesus
* Paul
* Gentiles

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Act out how Paul tells Timothy to encourage the believers to pray. In another part of the room, you can place believers and people in authority in two groups. Act out how Timothy tells the believers what Paul has instructed the believers to do.

Pause the drama.

Ask the people who play the believers, "What do you feel when you hear that you should pray for kings and other leaders?" The people might answer things like:

* I feel frustrated when I pray for leaders, because the leaders make my life difficult; or
* I feel confused, because I do not know what to pray for people who do bad things.

Act out how the believers pray all kinds of prayers for the leaders. The authority leaders can act out how they view these followers of Jesus who live in a way that is godly and dignified.

Pause the drama.

Ask the people who play the community leaders, "What do you feel when you see how Christians live?" These people might answer things like:

* I feel concerned because the Christians live differently than we do; or
* I feel impressed at the good way that the Christians live with people in our community.

Have one person act as God and a group of people act as humans. Act out God's desire to save all people and for all people to know the truth. Some of the people who were the community leaders could also act in this group.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays God, "What do you feel when people do not know the truth?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel sad that people do not know the truth about how I love them.

Ask the group who plays the people, "What do you feel when you do not know the truth?" These people might answer things like:

* I feel scared that I do not know what God wants from me; or
* I feel confused about how I can live the best kind of life.

Have another person act out how Jesus is the mediator between God and all people.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Jesus, "What do you feel when you act as the mediator to bring peace to people and God?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel happy that I can make peace between God and people; or
* I feel sad that people are not at peace with God.

Act out how Paul preaches the message of the good news to Gentiles. Some of the people who were the community leaders could also act as Gentiles who hear Paul's message.

Pause the drama.

Ask the group of people who play the Gentiles, "What do you feel when you hear the good news that God wants to save you?" These people might answer things like:

* I feel happy that God wants to save me and everyone I know; or
* I feel confused about this news, because this news is different from what my community and I believe.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul asks Timothy to tell the believers in Ephesus to pray for everyone. Paul says the believers should make requests, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings. Together, these words show that Paul wants the believers to pray all kinds of prayers. It is best if you can find specific words or phrases for each word. But the most important thing is that this group of four words shows that Paul wants the believers to pray in every way. The whole idea means, "Pray every kind of prayer for everyone."

A **request** is when someone asks for something.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 2:8–15 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

Paul has been encouraging the church to pray for all people, including their kings and rulers, because God wants to save all people. Now, Paul moves to directly confront some of the problems that the false teachings cause in the church. First Paul talks about problems with some men in the church. Then Paul talks about problems with some women in the church.

Paul begins when Paul talks about problems with some men in the church. These men argue with each other and get angry with one another. Paul tells the men that he wants them to stop getting angry and arguing. Instead, Paul tells the men to lift up their holy hands in prayer. When Paul tells the men to pray and lift up holy hands, Paul reminds the men of the ways God has commanded his people to worship God. The Old Testament talks about clean or holy hands as a picture of clean or holy hearts. If a person has a clean heart, it means that the person obeys God and follows God's commands. Paul tells the men to forgive one another and worship with pure hearts.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story of someone you know who has a pure heart. What is that person like? How does the person handle conflict and forgiveness? Pause the audio here.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Here the men prayed with their hands lifted high. How do people pray in your community? Pause the audio here.

Paul then talks about problems with some women in the church. Some of the women in the church came to church dressed in a way that distracted people very much. When these women came, the women braided their hair and wore gold, pearls, and expensive clothing. The women wanted to show off their wealth. Paul tells these women that the women should dress in a way that is appropriate or respectable for coming to church to worship God. Paul says that a godly woman should not put on expensive clothes or expensive jewelry. Instead, Paul says that a godly woman should put on good works. In other words, people should do good works and honor God in the same way people put on nice clothes. Paul does not mean that expensive clothes or jewelry are wrong themselves. These things become a problem if people care more about how they impress other people than about how they worship God with the way they live.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What does appropriate and respectful clothing look like in different situations in your community? Tell a story of when someone wore the wrong kind of clothing to a community event. How do people who are rich and people who are poor interact with each other? Pause the audio here.

Next, Paul talks about another problem in the church service. Some women in the church were disrupting the service. So Paul tells these women that the women should learn with a peaceful attitude. The women should submit themselves to the leaders in the church. Paul says those women are not allowed to teach the men or to use authority over the men.

Stop here and discuss these questions as a group: What are men's jobs or women's jobs? Pause the audio here.

Paul then reminds the church of stories from the beginning of the Bible to support Paul's instructions. These stories tell of how God created the world. The stories tell how people first rebelled against God. Paul reminds the church that when God created people, God created Adam first and then Eve. Paul also reminds the church that Eve was the one who Satan tricked.

And then Paul says something that might sound confusing. Paul says God will save a woman through how the woman gives birth to a child. Though it is hard to understand what Paul says, we do know what Paul does *not* say. Paul is very clear in his other teachings that God saves us from our sins when we trust in Jesus. God does not save us because of the things we do. So Paul does not mean that having a child saves a woman from her sins.

There are three main ways to understand what Paul says. First, some people think that Paul talks about the birth of Jesus. In the story of Adam and Eve, God promises that a baby will be born who will defeat Satan and save God's people. So even though Satan tricked Eve, and Eve sinned, God gives salvation to women through Jesus. Second, other people think Paul wants to encourage these women to live as godly mothers. This picture of a woman who gives birth represents this kind of woman. Paul may say these things because there might be a false teaching that tells women not to get married or not to have children. Third, some people think that Paul talks about how God protects women from physical danger when women give birth.

It is possible that many women in Ephesus who did not believe in Jesus followed the goddess of Ephesus. These women were especially loud and arrogant, and these women relied on the goddess of Ephesus to protect the women while they gave birth. In Paul's instructions to the women, Paul may contrast those unbelieving women with the way that women who believe in Jesus should act.

Stop here and discuss these questions as a group: Paul says God will save women through how a woman gives birth to a child. What does your church community currently think about this? Now think about the things you have learned in this entire passage about how both men and women live pure and godly lives. How does that teaching affect how you understand the last part of this passage?

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 2:8–15 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has four parts.

**In the first part:** Paul gives instructions for how the men in the church are supposed to pray.

**In the second part:** Paul gives instructions for how the women should dress and act.

**In the third part:** Paul gives instructions that women should learn with submissive hearts. Paul does not want the women to teach or take positions of authority over men.

**In the fourth part:** Paul reminds the church how God created Adam and Eve, and how Satan deceived Eve.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The people who are a part of the church, including the men and women
* Adam
* Eve

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Remember that Paul deals with issues that disrupt the worship services of the Ephesian churches.

In the first scene, Paul gives instructions to the men who disrupt the service with their anger and arguments. Paul wants these men to stop how they focus on their arguments and instead to focus on doing things that are acceptable to God and to worship God with pure hearts. When the men lift up holy hands, it is not the men's hands that are holy. What is holy is that the men act in a way that is acceptable to God.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Discuss how you could describe what the men do. Pause the audio here.

In the second scene, Paul gives instructions to the women who disrupt the service with the way that the women dress. Sometimes when women focused on the way they dressed, people thought the women showed off how wealthy the women were or how the women were more important than other people and did not have to respect anyone else. Paul says that Paul does not want the women to dress with clothes that are too expensive or with too many pearls and gold jewelry. Paul says that he does not want the women to braid their hair, or to twist their hair into fancy designs. Paul does not tell the women that they cannot wear these things, but Paul is making a contrast. Paul wants these women to focus on godliness and good works rather than to focus on what the women wear. Paul wants the women to also have pure hearts when they come to worship God.

Stop here and discuss these questions as a group: Discuss how you could describe how the women dressed. How will you describe that the women are to put on good works? Pause the audio here.

In the third scene, Paul tells the women they should learn quietly and submissively. Paul does not permit women to teach or use authority over a man. When Paul says he does not allow women to have authority over a man, there are two different ways to understand what Paul means. The word for authority could be a positive thing or a negative thing. Some people think Paul uses the word authority in a positive way to talk about how someone leads a church. If this is right, Paul means that women should not have positions of authority in the church. Others think that Paul uses the word authority in a negative way to talk about a person who forcefully or disrespectfully takes authority over someone. If this is right, Paul means that women should not disrespectfully take control of the church.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How does your church feel about women in leadership positions? Pause the audio here.

In the fourth scene, Paul reminds the believers that God formed Adam first and then God formed Eve. Satan deceived Eve and she sinned. There are two ways to understand what Paul says here. Some people think Paul means that because God formed Adam first, God created men to lead the church. Other people think Paul uses the stories of Adam and Eve to confront a false teaching in the church. That false teaching led to women in the church disrespectfully taking control and teaching false truths.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell about a time someone used a story from the past to show that something is true. Pause the audio here.

Then Paul goes back to talk about women in general. Paul says that God will save women through how women have children if the women continue in faith, love, and holiness with self\-control. When Paul says God will save women *if* the women continue to do these things, Paul makes a connection between the women's salvation and the way the women live. As we mentioned earlier, God does not save people because of people's actions. But, our actions *do* show that we have been saved. Paul means that if God has saved these women, then the women will continue to live godly lives. This means the women expect good things from God, love God and other people, and live holy lives, and that the women do all of these things with self\-control.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. As you tell this story, think about all the different people in the church gathering. How did the men act, and how did God want the men to act? How did the women act, and how did God want them to act? In each scene, have the men or women first act in the disruptive way Paul tells them not to act. Then, as Paul tells the men and women how they should act, have the men and women change their behavior to follow Paul's instructions. How can you show the disruption that these men and women's actions had in the church?

Embodying the Text
------------------

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 2:8–15 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has four parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* The people who are a part of the church, including the men and women
* Adam
* Eve

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "I want men to pray in all places with holy hands lifted up, not with anger or arguing."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel frustrated that these men are more focused on how they argue with each other than on how they worship God; or
* I feel sad that these arguments get in the way of people worshiping God.

Paul says, "I also want women to dress in appropriate and respectable ways and show self\-control. I do not want women to wear clothing that shows everyone that the women are wealthy. Instead, the women should focus on doing good deeds and following God."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the women who are learning with submissive hearts, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I want God to be honored and praised, not me. I want my good works and godliness to show God worship; or
* I used to care more about what others thought about me, but now I care more about what God thinks about me.

Paul says, "I want women to learn quietly with submissive hearts. I do not want a woman to teach or use authority over a man."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am frustrated because people interrupt other people who worship God! or
* I am frustrated because there are a lot of people who teach who should not teach. These people just cause confusion. I want these people to stop.

Paul says, "These women cannot teach or have authority. After all, God formed Adam first and Eve second. Also, Eve was deceived and became a sinner. But God will save a woman through her having a child if she continues in faith, love, and holiness with self\-control."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays someone who goes to the church, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel a little confused about what Paul means here; or
* I feel like Paul might be making some kind of mistake; or
* I feel like this is not fair to women; or
* I am so glad that God will protect and save these women!

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 2:8–15 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul says that men should **pray** and lift up holy, or pure, hands. Use the same word for pray that you used in previous passages. Look up pray in the Master Glossary for more information. In this case, holy means pure, good, or acceptable. These men do things that are good and acceptable to God.

Paul talks about **self\-control** two times in this passage. At the beginning of this passage, Paul says that women should dress appropriately with respectfulness and self\-control. Then at the end of this passage, Paul says that women will be saved if they continue in faith, love, and holiness with self\-control. Both times, self\-control means the same thing. Self\-control means to use good judgment and act in an appropriate way for the situation.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for self\-control. Use the same word or phrase throughout 1 Timothy and 2 Timothy. Pause the audio here.

Paul says women should put on **good works** instead of expensive clothing and jewelry. Good works are a person's actions that follow God's good instructions. To do good works means we do what God wants us to do and we live like God wants us to live.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **good works**. Pause the audio here.

Paul says women should put on good works which are appropriate or fitting for a woman who claims or professes **godliness**. Godliness means to greatly respect and worship God. To profess godliness means you claim to worship God and live as God's commands.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **godliness**. For more information, look up godly in the Master Glossary. Pause the audio here.

Paul tells women to learn in **quietness** and submission. Quietness does not mean that a woman does not talk at all while she learns. Instead, quietness means to act in a way that is not disruptive or distracting. Someone who is quiet is calm or peaceful. Use the same word or phrase for quiet or quietness as you used in the previous passage.

When someone learns in **submission**, or when someone submits, that person is willing to obey and respect the people who have authority over that person.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **submissiveness**. Pause the audio here.

Paul says that Eve was deceived and became a **transgressor**. Transgressor is almost the same as **sinner**. To transgress something is to disobey a specific rule. So when Paul says that Eve became a transgressor, Paul means that Eve disobeyed a specific rule God gave not to eat the fruit.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **sinner** or **transgressor**. You may use the same word for sinner as you used in previous passages. For more information, look up sin in the Master Glossary. Pause the audio here.

Paul says that God will **save** women through how women give birth to a child. Here save can mean a couple of different things. One way is to think that Paul means God will save a woman spiritually. Save could also mean to protect someone physically.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **save**. For more information on saved, please listen to salvation in the Master Glossary. Do you have a word that you could use for either being saved spiritually or being physically protected? If you do, discuss whether or not that could fit here. Pause the recording here.

Paul says that these women are saved if they continue in faith, love, and holiness.

When someone continues in **faith**, that person continues to live believing in what God has said and done, believing in Jesus. Use the same word or phrase for faith as you used in previous passages. For more information on faith, refer to the Master Glossary.

When someone continues in **love**, that person continues to love God and love people. Use the same word or phrase for love as you used in previous passages.

When someone continues in **holiness**, that person continues to live in the way God has called people to live.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for holiness. For more information about what it means to be holy, please listen to holy in the Master Glossary.

Setting the Stage

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 3:1–7 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In previous passages, Paul wrote to Timothy that false teachers had caused some of the problems in the church. In this passage, Paul gives Timothy a list of qualities for good church leaders.

Paul begins when Paul repeats a true saying that many other people agree on and accept. This saying is that people who want to be leaders in the church want a good work or task. These people want to do good for the church and for Jesus. In this passage Paul calls the leaders of the church "overseers."

Then Paul says that because this is a good task, the people who do the task must be a certain kind of person.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture what does a good leader do? Who can be a leader? Why does your community require a leader to have those qualities and status? Pause this audio here.

At the beginning, Paul says that an overseer must be above reproach. Others should not be able to find fault with, blame, or criticize an overseer.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what kind of things would others criticize in a leader? Pause this audio here.

Next Paul says that an overseer must be the husband of one wife. An overseer should not be married to more than one woman, and an overseer should not have sexual relations with a woman who is not the overseer's wife.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what do people think about a man who is a husband of only one wife? Pause this audio here.

Next Paul lists three qualities that are very similar to each other. Paul says an overseer must be sober\-minded. In other words, an overseer should be in full control of his thoughts and not allow emotions to control the overseer. An overseer must also be self\-controlled, or able to control his own actions. Next Paul says that an overseer must be dignified, or act in a respectful way towards others.

An overseer must also be hospitable. This means the overseer regularly has guests in his home. The overseer gives his guests drinks or a meal or even a place to stay. The overseer does this in a way that welcomes and honors his guests.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What do you do to make guests feel welcomed and honored? Pause this audio here.

Next Paul says that an overseer must be able to teach. We remember from the beginning of the letter to Timothy that there were false teachers in the church of Ephesus. To appoint overseers who can teach God's Word well will help protect the church from false teachings that lead to useless arguments and divisions.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Describe the different kinds of teachers in your community. Who do these people teach, how do they teach, and what do they teach? Pause this audio here.

Until now, Paul listed good qualities that an overseer should have. Next Paul lists bad qualities that an overseer should not have. An overseer must not be a drunkard or a person who drinks a lot of wine or alcohol.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What do drunkards do? How does a person's drunkenness affect their family and the people around them? Pause this audio here.

An overseer must also not be violent. The overseer should not hit, push, or injure people, animals, or things. Paul says that, instead of these bad qualities, the overseer must be patient or gentle. The overseer must not quickly or easily get into fights or arguments. At the end of the list of bad qualities, Paul says that an overseer must not love money.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture how does money influence the decisions and actions of leaders and people with power? Pause this audio here.

After Paul gives a list of good qualities and a list of bad qualities, Paul says that an overseer must manage his own household well. Any family members who the overseer cares for are part of the overseer's household. Any slaves or servants are also part of the overseer's household. A man who manages his household well is also a good manager of his property, work, and business. An overseer manages his household in a way that is orderly, responsible, and keeps relationships. One way an overseer manages his household well is by managing his children. Paul says that an overseer should have children who are submissive, or obedient, to the overseer. These children could be of any age. The overseer should manage his household with dignity, or in a respectable way. Paul gives Timothy the reason why an overseer must manage the overseer's household well. Paul says that if someone does not know how to manage his household well, that person will not be able to care for God's church.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Who and what are part of households in your community? Give examples of how people might manage their household badly. Pause this audio here.

After this, Paul tells Timothy that an overseer must not be a new Christian, a person who not long ago became a follower of Jesus. Paul also gives Timothy a reason for this quality. Paul says that if an overseer is a new Christian, this overseer may become proud and fall into the judgment of the devil. Maybe the devil will judge or punish this person. But more probably, God will judge or punish this person together or in a similar way as God judged the devil, because the devil thought he was greater than God himself.

Paul ends this list of qualities with a quality a little like the first one. The first quality was that an overseer must be above reproach. At the end of the list, Paul says that outsiders should think good of these overseers. Paul also gives a reason for this last quality. Paul tells Timothy that if people who are not Christian think badly of the overseer, the overseer will fall into disgrace, he will be shamed, and he will fall into the snare of the devil. A snare is a trap that people use to trap, or catch by surprise, animals and birds. Like birds or animals who fall into a hunters' trap, an overseer who outsiders shame falls into the trap of the devil.

Stop here and look at a picture of an animal snare as a group.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 3:1–7 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has four parts.

**In the first part:** Paul tells Timothy a saying that many other people trust and accept. Paul tells Timothy that a man who wants to be an overseer wants a good task.

**In the second part:** Paul lists good qualities that an overseer has.

**In the third part:** Paul lists bad qualities that an overseer must not have.

**In the fourth part:** Paul gives three more good qualities and a reason why these qualities are important.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* Other believers, especially from the church in Ephesus
* A person who wants to be an overseer
* If you would like, you may choose to have a character represent each quality of an overseer, or you could have one person represent the good qualities, and one person represent the bad qualities of the overseer.
* People who belong to the overseer's household
* People who are not believers
* The devil

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In the first part, Paul repeats a saying that many others trust and accept. Paul says that to be an overseer is a good task. Because it is a good task, the people who are overseers must have certain qualities.

In the next three parts, Paul lists qualities of an overseer.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do you make lists in your language? For example, make a list of all the qualities of a good wife. Pay attention to how you show that you have started and ended the list, and how you order the good and bad qualities. Discuss how you would stop the list to explain why someone should have a certain quality, and then what you would say to continue the list. Pause this audio here.

For each quality, Paul should tell Timothy if that quality is good or bad. In the second part are good qualities that an overseer must have. In the third part are bad qualities that an overseer must not have. And in the fourth part are three more qualities and the reason those qualities are important. Paul tells Timothy why an overseer must manage his own household well. Paul says this as a question. Paul says, "If an overseer does not know how to manage his household well, how will he care for God's church?" The answer to the question is obvious. A person who does not know how to manage his own household will not be able to take care of God's church. Paul says this as a question to emphasize how important this quality is.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about how you described a good leader in step one. Pay attention to how you emphasized why you think a certain quality of a person is very important. How will you talk about how an overseer manages his household? Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. As you visualize the passage, make sure to visualize each quality of an overseer.

Visualize how Paul speaks to Timothy. Have an object or person to represent each quality of an overseer. In part two, group together all the good qualities on one side. In part three, on another side, group together all the bad qualities. When you reach the quality "violent," move the person or object who represents this quality to the good side and turn it into "gentle or patient." In part four, add each of the three qualities to the correct group, good or bad. Act or visualize each quality, and think of a way to visualize the reason for the quality as well. At the end, show an overseer who has a bad reputation in the community. The people in the community shame the overseer. Show how the devil makes a trap for the overseer and how the overseer falls into the trap.

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 3:1–7 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has four parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* Other believers, especially from the church in Ephesus
* A person who wants to be an overseer
* If you would like, you may choose to have a character represent each quality of an overseer, or you could have one person represent the good qualities, and one person represent the bad qualities of the overseer.
* People who belong to the overseer's household
* People who are not believers
* The devil

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

In part one, Paul says to Timothy that this saying is trustworthy: "If a man wants to be an overseer, he wants a good work."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the man who wants to be an overseer, "What are you thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I want to be an overseer; or
* The church has many problems. The church needs good teachers.

In part two, Paul shows Timothy a good overseer. This overseer is above reproach, a husband of only one wife, in control of his thoughts, self\-controlled, respectable, hospitable, and able to teach.

Pause the drama.

Ask the people who play the guests of the man who wants to be an overseer, "How do you feel when you visit this man?" The people might answer things like:

* I feel welcomed and honored.

Ask the people who play the people in the church of Ephesus, "What do you think about this man who wants to be an overseer?" The people might answer things like:

* I think he is a good man; or
* I think this man will not shame us; or
* I want other people to think well of Christians, and I trust this man to give us a good name; or
* I think this man will make wise decisions.

In part three, Paul shows Timothy bad qualities that an overseer should not have. The bad qualities are drunkard, violent, quarrelsome, and lover of money. When Paul shows the bad quality, "violent," Paul shows the opposite good quality, "gentle or patient."

Pause the drama.

Ask the people who play the people in the church of Ephesus, "What do you think about a man who has these bad qualities?" The people might answer things like:

* I think this man is not responsible; or
* I think this man will shame us; or
* I think this man will not be able to help us love each other and be at peace with one another; or
* I think this man is corrupt and just wants money.

In part four, Paul shows three more qualities of an overseer. The overseer manages his household well, and the overseer's children submit to the overseer. Paul says that if a man does not know how to manage his own household, that man will not be able to care for God's church.

Pause the drama.

Ask the members of the household of an overseer, "What do you think or feel about this man?" The people might answer things like:

* I feel well cared for; or
* I want to honor the overseer and follow his instructions; or
* I am grateful for such a master.

Ask the people who play the people in the church of Ephesus, "What do you think about this man who wants to be an overseer?" The people might answer things like:

* I think this man is responsible and capable; or
* I trust this man to make wise decisions.

Paul says also that the overseer is not a new Christian. Paul explains that a new Christian who is an overseer may become prideful and fall into the judgment of the devil.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the new Christian who became an overseer, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel proud; or
* I have so much power, and other people should obey me; or
* Other people should show me honor because I am an overseer.

At the end, Paul says that outsiders must think well of the overseer. Paul explains that if outsiders do not think well of an overseer, the overseer will fall into shame and fall into the snare of the devil.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the devil, "What are you thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I look for a way to shame the church; or
* I will hurt the church when I catch the overseer as he does something shameful.

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 3:1–7 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

If you have already translated the letter of Paul to Titus, listen to your recording of Titus 1:5–9, where Paul gives a list of qualities that an elder should have. You will want to remember what words you used in Titus and use similar words here. Pause this audio here.

In this passage, Paul gives Timothy a list of qualities for good church leaders. Paul begins when he repeats a true saying that many other people agree on and accept. In this letter to Timothy, Paul repeats three different true sayings that other people accept. Each time Paul repeats one of these sayings, Paul uses the same words, "**This saying is trustworthy**." Paul used these words once before when Paul repeated the saying, "Jesus Christ came to the world to save sinners." In that passage, Paul told Timothy that Paul was the biggest sinner. Use the same words you used there to talk about a trustworthy saying.

In this passage, the saying that Paul repeats is that people who want to be leaders in the church want a good work or task. In this passage, Paul calls the leaders of the church **overseers**. This is probably another name for a church elder. In the book of Acts, when Paul was in Miletus, Paul called the elders of the church of Ephesus to come to Paul. When the elders came, Paul spoke to the elders one last time. Paul said that the elders must watch over themselves and the sheep of God. Paul says that the Holy Spirit made these elders to be overseers over the church of God, and that God bought this church with God's own blood.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you used for **overseer**. Look up overseer in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in Acts and Titus, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul says that an overseer must also be **self\-controlled** and dignified or **respectable**. In the passage before this one, Paul says to Timothy that women should wear respectable clothing and act with modesty and self\-control. Use the same words you used there to talk about respectable and self\-controlled women.

Until now Paul listed good qualities that an overseer should have. Next Paul lists bad qualities that an overseer should not have. An overseer must not be a drunkard or violent. After the quality "not violent," your audio version might have the quality "not greedy for bribes." If your audio does not include this quality, do not add it.

After a list of good qualities and a list of bad qualities, Paul says that an overseer must manage his own **household** well, and that an overseer should have children who are submissive to the overseer. A household could include the family, servants, and anyone who lived and worked in the house.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word you will use for **household**. Look up household in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have translated household in previous books of the Bible, use the same word here. Pause this audio here.

The way that the overseer keeps his children **submissive** should be with all **dignity**, or in a respectable way. This is the same word for submission or obedience as when Paul said that women should submit when the women learn. Use the same word here as you used in the previous passage. To have dignity is like when Paul says to Timothy that the Ephesians should pray for leaders, so that the Ephesians may be dignified in every way. Use the same words you used there to talk about dignity.

Paul gives Timothy the reason for this quality. Paul says that if someone does not know how to manage his household well, that person will not be able to care for God's **church**, or the community of people who believe in Jesus.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **church**. Use the same word or phrase for church as you used in the book of Acts. Look up church in the Master Glossary for more information. Pause this audio here.

After this, Paul tells Timothy that an overseer must not be a new Christian. Paul says that if an overseer is a new Christian, this overseer may become proud and fall into the **judgement**, or punishment, of the **devil**. The devil is the enemy of God. In this case, the devil is another way to talk about Satan.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **judgement** and **devil**. Use the same word or phrase for judgement and devil as you used in previous books. Look up devil in the Master Glossary for more information. Pause this audio here.

At the end of the list, Paul says that outsiders should think good of these overseers. Paul tells Timothy that if people who are not believers think badly of the overseer, the overseer will fall into disgrace and he will fall into the **snare** of the devil. A snare is a net that people used to trap or catch by surprise animals and birds.

Stop here and look at a picture of a snare as a group. How will you talk about a snare in your translation?

Setting the Stage

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 3:8–13 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this passage, Paul continues to teach Timothy about the kind of believers who Timothy should choose to serve as official church workers. Paul talks about official church workers, or deacons, in similar ways as he talked about overseers in the previous passage. In contrast to the leaders who taught wrong things and divided the church, Paul says here that good leaders behave with true faith and honesty throughout those leaders' lives.

In many places, people think that only people of low status should serve others. People who think this way want others to serve them. They themselves do not want to serve other people. But Jesus showed his followers how to love others by serving those people. Similarly, in this passage, Paul says that the kind of person who would make a good servant of the church is someone who respects others, and who others can trust.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Share a story in which someone served you, or in which you served someone else. Pay attention to how you talk about how the person served and what that person did. Pause the audio here.

A deacon is dignified. This means that the deacon is someone who other people respect and honor because of the way the deacon behaves. The deacon is truthful in what he says, and the deacon does not say things that he does not mean. The deacon must also not drink too much wine. Wine is a drink that people make from fermented grapes. Wine is alcoholic, and if people drink too much wine, those people will get drunk. During the time when Paul wrote this letter, people normally drank wine when they ate their meals. Similar to Paul's instructions for elders in the previous passage, deacons also must not get drunk.

Deacons must also not be shamefully greedy to gain money or possessions. A shamefully greedy person would lie, cheat, take bribes, or do something else that is wrong in order to get what he wants.

Paul says deacons are people who hold the "mystery of the faith" or the "deep truths of the faith." Before Jesus came, we did not know God's plan to restore people to himself. Now, God has revealed this secret, or mystery. Deacons consistently believe and follow the true message of faith that God has revealed to people. Deacons should have a clear conscience. This means that the deacons do not feel guilty or ashamed, because the deacons know they have done right things and not wrong things. A conscience causes a person to feel good when he does what is right. A conscience also causes a person to feel ashamed or guilty when they do something wrong.

Paul says that someone should test deacons. Paul does not say who should test the deacons. But before deacons can serve in the church, the deacons must prove to be blameless. In other words, no one can truthfully accuse the deacons of wrong actions.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do people prove that they have good character in your culture? What kinds of things do these people do to prove that they have a good character? Perhaps share a story of someone who has consistently shown excellent behavior and character as that person has dealt with difficult circumstances. Pause the audio here.

Paul now focuses on the qualities of the women. The word that Paul used for women can either refer to any woman or to a wife specifically. We do not know if these women were deacons, or if these women were the male deacons' wives. In any case, some women had significant roles in church life, and Paul wants to speak to the qualities that these women need to demonstrate as well.

Like the deacons, these women must also be dignified, or worthy of respect. The women must not gossip or say any hurtful things about other people. These women must be sober\-minded, that is, they must control themselves and behave in an appropriate way. These women do not get drunk, and they also do not lose control of themselves in any other way. The women must also be faithful in all things, which means people can trust these women to do all that the women say they will do.

In the final part of this passage, Paul requires that deacons behave similarly to overseers in some ways. Just as an overseer is to be a man, or husband, of one woman, and just as an overseer must manage their children and household well, so too must a deacon. And finally, Paul says that people will honor and respect deacons who fulfill their responsibilities well. Deacons who have served well can be confident and speak boldly about their faith, and they will grow to trust God more and more.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do you show honor to leaders in your context? How do you show honor to people who serve others?

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 3:8–13 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul describes the good behavior that a deacon, or official church worker, must consistently show.

**In the second part:** The wives or women should live in such a way that demonstrates a similar standard of good behavior.

**In the third part:** The deacons should also manage their families well, and Paul says that God will reward deacons who do well.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* Deacons
* God
* Others in the church
* Wives or women
* Children and household
* Christ Jesus

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Paul begins this passage when he connects it to the previous passage about overseers. Paul is about to describe deacons in a similar way. Some of the same terms and ideas appear in both the previous passage about overseers and this one about deacons.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What ideas in this passage sound similar to ideas Paul used in the previous passage about overseers? How will you begin this passage to show how it connects with similar ideas in the previous passage? Pause the audio here.

As you listen, pay special attention to the different lists in this passage, and think about how you can draw or use objects to visualize these concepts. First, Paul teaches Timothy that a deacon must live in such a way that other people honor and respect the deacon.

Then Paul says that a deacon should always speak the truth. A deacon should not be "double\-tongued." In other words, a deacon should not speak two different things or say something that the deacon does not mean. A deacon should be sincere in everything the deacon says.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what do people say about a person when they know that person is dishonest or often says things that he does not mean? Perhaps there is a similar common saying that would be appropriate to use here. Pause the audio here.

A deacon must not drink too much wine. A deacon must not be shamefully greedy. A deacon must consistently believe the deep truths of the faith, and he must do so with a clear conscience. In other words, the deacon must know that he has done nothing wrong to feel guilty about. And before a person can become a deacon, the deacon must pass a test and prove to be blameless.

The second part of the passage focuses on the wives or women. Paul connects this part to the previous part about deacons. Whether these are women who are in the role of deacon, or wives of deacons, these women must live in such a way that other people honor and respect the women. These women must not say hurtful things about other people. These women must practice self\-control and not allow their emotions to cause the women to do wrong or hurtful things. These women must be faithful in all things, which means people can trust these women to do all that the women say they will do.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What ideas in this part sound similar to ideas in the previous part about deacons? How will you begin this part of the passage to show how it connects with similar ideas in the first part? Pause the audio here.

The final part of the passage focuses on the family life of the deacons. Deacons are to only have one wife, and to be faithful to their wife. Deacons also must manage their children and household well.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Recall the phrases that you used to describe these ideas in the previous passage about overseers. Translate these ideas in a similar way. Pause the audio here.

Paul hopes that deacons will truly serve well, and Paul mentions a reason and a reward for serving well. Paul says, "Those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing, or honor, for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus." When a deacon serves well, the deacon will have honor, like a person who stands strong. The deacon will also be confident to speak boldly about his trust in Jesus, and the deacon will grow to trust Jesus more and more.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. As you do this, you might want to have drawings or objects to represent Paul, Timothy, God, one or more deacons, other people in the community, wives or women, the children and household of the deacon, and Christ Jesus. The people in the community will respect and closely examine the deacon. The deacon should show himself to behave honorably in the different ways that Paul states. Think about how you will show the different good things that deacons, their wives, and other women do. As you begin to retell the story of these verses, remember that Paul's ideas are first about deacons, then the wives or women, then about their families and the reward for the deacons' good work. These movements may help your group to visualize the flow of the passage.

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 3:8–13 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* God
* Deacons
* Others in the church
* Wives or women
* Children and household
* Christ Jesus

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Just like the overseers, deacons should be dignified, speak truthfully, not get drunk, and not be greedy. A deacon should consistently teach good teaching and understand if they do right or wrong things. The church should test deacons to see if the deacons are blameless.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays a deacon, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I think about how I can serve others; or
* I am happy to serve; or
* This is hard, and I feel nervous that I may not pass the test.

The wives of the deacons should live in such a way that other people honor and respect them. The wives must not say hurtful things about other people. The wives must practice self\-control. The wives must be faithful in all things.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the woman here, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel honored that my brothers and sisters consider me worthy to serve in this way; or
* I am happy to live in this way, because I know I honor God.

A deacon should be faithful to his one wife and manage his household well. Then God rewards that deacon through the respect that the other people in the community have for the deacon. And the deacon can boldly speak about his faith as the deacon trusts Christ Jesus more and more.

Pause the drama.

Ask the people who play the other members of the church, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The people might answer things like:

* I love this man because he is so helpful and trustworthy; or
* I am happy that this man does such good things; or
* I truly trust this person because he is a good person.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 3:8–13 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

A **deacon** is someone who is a servant to others. In the context of the church, a deacon is a Christian who has a special job in the church. Deacons take care of the special needs of believers. In this passage, Paul does not describe the deacon's specific tasks or skills, but instead focuses on the deacon's qualities of consistent, good, respectable behavior.

For this serving role, most English translations use the word "deacons," but another option is to say something like "church helpers" or "official church workers." You should choose a term that is suitable in your culture for such a leadership job.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What terms do people often use in your culture to talk about people who serve others? What terms might be appropriate to use in the context of the church for an official church worker? Choose the term that is most appropriate. Look up deacon in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause the audio here.

Paul says that both the deacons and the women should be **dignified**. This means the deacons and women should be people who other people respect and honor because of the way they behave. Paul also used this term earlier in 1 Timothy. Use this same word or phrase for dignified for both the deacons and the women.

A deacon must also not drink too much **wine**. Wine is a drink that people make from fermented grapes. Wine is alcoholic, and if someone drinks too much wine, that person will get drunk. At the time when Paul wrote this letter, people normally drank wine with their meals. Similar to Paul's instructions for elders in the previous passage, deacons also must not get drunk.

Stop here and discuss what word you will use for **wine**. Look up wine in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause the audio here.

A **conscience** causes a person to feel good when that person does what is right. A conscience also causes a person to feel ashamed or guilty if that person does something wrong. A person who has a clear conscience does not feel guilty or ashamed, but rather feels good, because that person knows he has done the right thing. Paul used this term near the beginning of this letter to Timothy. Use the same term for clear conscience as you did in that passage.

In the next part of this passage, the word that Paul uses for **women** can either refer to any woman or to a wife specifically. We do not know if Paul addresses the male deacons' wives, or if Paul addresses women who were deacons. In any case, some women had significant roles in church life, and Paul wants to speak to the qualities that these women need to demonstrate as well. Some languages have a natural way to leave this term ambiguous. But in some languages, like English, people must choose a specific word. If this is the case for your language, it is best to choose "women."

In the final part of this passage, Paul requires that deacons behave similarly to overseers in some ways. Just as an overseer is to be a man, or husband, of one woman, and just as an overseer must manage their children and **household** well, so too must a deacon. Translate these concepts in a similar way as you did in the previous passage, and use the same word or phrase for household as you used in previous passages. Remember that household is in the Master Glossary.

When Paul speaks of **faith** in Christ Jesus, use the same word or phrase for faith that you have used in previous passages. Look up faith in the Master Glossary for more information.

Finally, notice how Paul says that these people's faith is in **Christ** Jesus. Use the same word for Christ that you have used in previous passages. Look up Christ in the Master Glossary for more information.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 3:14–16 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

At this time in history, the church in the world was rapidly growing, so churches needed clear instructions about leadership. Earlier in the letter, Paul instructed Timothy how to handle false teachers. Then Paul explained how the overseers and deacons in the church should behave. Paul explained these things in a letter to Timothy because Paul might not be able to visit Timothy for a while, and Paul wanted the believers in the Ephesian church to know how believers should act.

Paul uses special language to help us understand how believers in the church work together. First, Paul says that believers in the church are like a household. Christians are God's children, and Christians relate to one another as brothers and sisters. As such, Christians are like children and family who all live and work together in a household. However, this household is special, because it is the household of the living God. The living God is powerful and lives among the Christians. The living God transforms how the Christians live. Paul reminds these believers that their God is different from the false, weak gods that the Ephesians worship.

Paul describes the true teaching of Jesus as a building. Just as a pillar and foundation support a building, the community of believers, or the church, support and strengthen the true teaching of Jesus. Many cultures use pillars and foundations to make their buildings strong. The city of Ephesus had huge buildings that needed support in order to not fall apart. The builders made pillars or columns to connect the floor to the ceiling. The builders also made a foundation to connect the building to the earth so that the building could stand strong and not fall down.

Stop here and look at a picture of pillars and a temple foundation. Discuss as a group: How do you make your buildings strong? Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Paul talks about how the church should act as the household of God. How does being part of a household of God change the way Christians act with one another? Pause this audio here.

The living God lives among God's people in God's church. This truth is what allows the believers to be the strong foundation for the church. Now Paul bursts out in praise to God. Paul exclaims the greatness of "the mystery, or secret, of godliness," which is the secret that God revealed to us about how we can live a life that pleases God. You may remember from Acts that the Ephesians loved their false goddess Artemis and even called Artemis "great." Paul makes a contrast between the way the Ephesians thought their false goddess was great, and the way Jesus, the living God, is truly great. Paul uses a hymn, or song, that everyone would know to teach this important truth about Jesus.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Many churches and cultures recite songs together as a community in order to learn important truths well. Describe a time when you sang together with a group. What kind of things would you sing about? Pause this audio here.

The song is about how people saw Jesus in the flesh. In other words, Jesus became human. The song continues to teach how the Spirit vindicated Jesus, or showed that Jesus was right. Early Christians probably thought that the Spirit of God showed that Jesus was right when Jesus was baptized, or when God raised Jesus from the dead. In any case, the Spirit of God showed everyone that Jesus was who Jesus said he was, and that Jesus was innocent of any wrongdoing.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In many cultures around the world, judges declare that someone is innocent. How do judges declare someone is innocent in your culture? Tell a story about someone who was falsely accused but who a judge declared innocent. Pause this audio here.

It was important that even heavenly beings witnessed events in Jesus' life. Even angels were witnesses of who Jesus was. Angels are supernatural beings who God made to worship God. Jesus may have shown himself to angels at several points in Jesus' life, but this song does not tell us when this happened.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Who needs to witness good news? When someone proves someone else innocent of wrongdoing, who needs to hear that information? Pause this audio here.

Finally, the song talks about the mission of the church in the world. The disciples proclaim Jesus among the nations, or different people groups throughout the world. The people of the world believed in Jesus. The song highlights what happens when the church proclaims Jesus to the nations—people throughout the world believe in Jesus! The song ends with Jesus "taken up in glory," which describes how God took Jesus up to heaven. This was an amazing thing!

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 3:14–16 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has two parts.

**In the first part:** Paul tells Timothy that Paul writes to Timothy so that believers will know how to behave in God's household.

**In the second part:** A hymn describes Jesus Christ as the mystery, or secret, of godliness.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul, as the author
* Timothy, as the recipient of this message
* The Ephesian church

The characters in the hymn are:

* Jesus Christ, as the subject of each part of the hymn
* Angels who saw Jesus
* Nations, or peoples, of the world
* The Holy Spirit who vindicated Jesus
* God who took Jesus up in glory

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In part one, pay attention to how Paul gives the reason why Paul writes the letter to Timothy—that Christians will know how to behave in the household of God.

Remember how Paul compares the church to the household of God. Paul also compares the church to a pillar and foundation that supports the truth of the teachings about Jesus.

Stop here and discuss how you will compare the members of the church to parts of a building. In your culture, what parts of a building help that building stand strong? How will that affect how you translate this part of the letter? Pause this audio here.

Pay attention to how Paul introduces the hymn in part two of this passage. Paul calls everyone to confess that the mystery, or secret, of godliness is great. In other words, the hymn explains the mystery of godliness through what Jesus did. The mystery is the secret that God has revealed to us when God explained to us the purpose of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. Godliness refers to the way that believers behave and the truth that believers know about Jesus.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: One way to translate the introduction to this hymn is, "We can affirm, 'The teachings that God has revealed are completely true.'" Discuss how you would translate calling people to understand and confess the mystery of godliness. Pause this audio here.

Remember that Paul calls for Timothy and the whole Ephesian church to acknowledge and agree with the hymn.

Although the hymn does not name Jesus, we know that it is Jesus who appeared "in the flesh," or as a human. The hymn talks about Jesus.

Remember that Jesus is both entirely God and entirely man. When the song talks about how Jesus revealed himself in the flesh, the song emphasizes that Jesus is entirely man. The hymn writer uses the word "flesh," or the physical part of a person's body, to show that Jesus had a body just like a human.

Remember "the Spirit" refers to the Holy Spirit, so be clear that the translation is not referring to a spirit other than the Spirit of God. Also pay attention to how the Holy Spirit vindicated Jesus or showed that Jesus was innocent.

Remember that angels are supernatural beings and that their purpose is to worship God.

Remember that the song's focus shifts to the believers proclaiming Jesus. When believers understand God's mystery or God's secret, believers preach about Jesus to other nations, or other people groups. As a result, people throughout the whole world believe in Jesus.

Remember that the song praises Jesus at the end of the song. God takes Jesus up in glory, or in majesty and power like a king.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: The hymn does not name Jesus, but sometimes a language might require that your translation make Jesus the subject of each action. Discuss whether you need to name Jesus in your translation of this hymn. Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. Consider using objects or people to represent the believers in the church. As Paul teaches how believers should live, show how believers are like a household of people who live and work together. Then show how the believers are like a foundation and pillars that make a building strong. How do you show strong buildings in your culture? Then, show how the believers watch the story of Jesus as Jesus becomes a man and as the Holy Spirit proclaims that Jesus is innocent of all wrongdoing. Show how believers preach about Jesus to everyone in the world, and how people all around the world believe! Then show how God takes Jesus up in majesty and power, like a king.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul is writing a letter to Timothy. Paul talks about how he hopes to see Timothy in person soon, but that Paul wants to write a letter with instructions so that believers know how to behave as members of the household of God.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I love Timothy, and I feel like a mentor to Timothy; or
* I am thinking about how this will help the Ephesian church.

The person who plays Paul describes the household of God as the church. Then the person who plays Paul talks about how the church of the living God is a pillar and foundation of the true teaching about Jesus.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel like the church is more important than I knew; or
* I am so glad that we have the living, powerful God in our household! or
* I think about my responsibility to share the truth about Jesus.

Paul explains that he includes a hymn that is a confession that believers agree on. This hymn expresses the greatness of the mystery of godliness, which is the secret God revealed about Jesus. The hymn starts when Jesus Christ reveals himself as a man. Then the Holy Spirit vindicates Jesus or shows Jesus to be innocent. Angels see Jesus.

Pause the drama.

Ask the people who play angels, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The people might answer things like:

* I feel like what we have always waited for is finally happening; or
* I think about God's great wisdom; or
* I think about how this was the plan from the beginning.

Then believers begin to proclaim the gospel to the nations, and people put their faith in Jesus Christ throughout the world. The hymn ends when God takes Jesus up in glory, which means God takes Jesus to be with God.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 3:14–16 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul says he writes to Timothy so people will know how to behave in God's **household**. Paul compares the **church** to the household of God. Paul suggests that the living God changes the way members of the church relate to each other. The Church is also called a pillar and foundation of truth. Use the same word or phrase for household and the Church as you used in previous passages. For more information on household and the Church, refer to the Master Glossary.

Paul declares that the **mystery** of where **godliness** comes from is great. The mystery is a secret that we did not know before, but God revealed this secret to us when God sent Jesus.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **mystery**, or secret. If you have translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word here. Pause this audio here.

Godliness is when someone is **godly**, or when someone lives a life that pleases God. Use the same word or phrase for godliness or godly as you used in previous passages, and look up godly in the Master Glossary for more information.

The hymn, or song, describes how the **Spirit** vindicated Jesus. Paul uses Spirit here to refer to the Holy Spirit.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for "the Spirit of God." Look up Holy Spirit in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

The hymn also describes how Jesus appeared to **angels**. Angels are supernatural beings that God created. Angels give God's messages to people, and the angels' purpose is to worship God.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **angels**. Look up angels in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Believers proclaim Jesus among the **nations**, or **peoples**. The word here can be **gentiles**, or non\-Jews, but people usually understand it as different people groups who speak different languages. These nations would all be gentiles, because they would not be Jewish. The hymn writer wants to emphasize that everyone everywhere hears about Jesus.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **nations**. Look up gentiles and nations in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

The world **believed** in Jesus, or the world trusted in Jesus.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **believed**. Look up belief in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

God took Jesus up in **glory**. God exalted Jesus when Jesus ascended to God. Here glory describes how God showed his great power and splendor. Use the same word or phrase for glory as you used in previous passages. For more information on glory, refer to the Master Glossary.

Setting the Stage

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 4:1–5 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this section of Paul's letter, Paul continues to discuss how the church should deal with false teachers. Paul connects what he discussed in the previous parts of the letter to what Paul will now continue to teach Timothy. What Paul says is not new to Timothy. At the beginning of Paul's letter, Paul already warned Timothy about the people in the church in Ephesus who spread wrong teachings in contrast to the truth Paul taught. These people speak nicely and convince many people to follow what they teach. Now, Paul wants Timothy to stop these people.

Stop here and discuss as a group: Who are the teachers at your church? How do people decide if what the teachers teach is right or wrong? Pause this audio here.

Just previously, Paul talked about the mystery that God revealed to God's people through Jesus. Paul now contrasts this with the teachings of the false teachers. Paul tells Timothy that the Spirit says clearly that the teachings of the false teachers come from demons, or spirits who want to deceive believers. Paul says that these teachers are hypocrites and liars. These teachers do not even realize that they spread wrong teachings.

Stop here and discuss as a group: What teachings do people consider wrong teachings in your community? What do you call people who teach wrong teachings? Can you tell a story about how people disagreed with their teachers and how both the people and the teachers reacted? Pause this audio here.

Some false teachers do not allow people to marry, and these teachers tell people not to eat certain foods. Paul continues to explain that God was the one who created these foods. Paul points out that believers can freely eat these foods, because when believers pray and thank God, God's Word, or God himself, speaks and makes the foods holy, or acceptable, to God. In fact, everything God creates is not only good, but also excellent and beautiful.

Stop here and discuss as a group: What are the foods that people in your culture cannot eat because of religious restrictions? In your family and culture, what customs do you have to thank God or the gods for food or for other things?

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 4:1–5 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts, and each part has its focus.

**In the first part:** The focus is on the spirit. Here, Paul talks about what the Spirit says in regard to the future situation of the church in Ephesus.

**In the second part:** The focus is on the false teachers. Here, Paul describes the false teachers and their teachings. Paul points out that the teachings are from the demons, and the teachers do not even realize that their teachings are wrong. Paul calls these teachers hypocritical liars. These teachers forbid people to marry, and these teachers order people not to eat certain foods.

**In the third part:** The focus is on the good things God has made. Paul's focus is to prove that the false teachers are wrong. Paul states that God created food and we should not reject any food. When believers pray and thank God, God blesses and makes the foods acceptable to God.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* The Spirit
* The false teachers
* The believers

As a group, pay attention to the following parts of the passage's setting:

It is important to remember that Paul addresses this letter to Timothy. Paul tells Timothy something important that God says to him. The Spirit of God, or God himself, says that in later times people will abandon the faith, or stop following Jesus. New Testament authors often used the phrase "later times" to refer to the last days of the earth, the time between when Jesus was raised from the dead to the time when Jesus comes back to fully establish his kingdom. Early Christians realised that they lived in those last days, just like we live in the same "last days" today. Perhaps Paul simply means that in the times the Ephesians lived, people would abandon their belief in Jesus. In any case, it is clear from the rest of this passage that false teachers were already teaching.

Stop here and discuss as a group: How will you start this passage to talk about what the Spirit of God says will happen in "later days"? Be sure that the rest of the passage is clear that these teachers are already teaching this false teaching now. Pause this audio here.

It is important to remember that the false teachers that Paul mentions here are part of the church in Ephesus. These false teachers mix with the true believers in the same church. Paul does not hesitate to use strong words like "hypocritical liars," because the teachings these people teach are from the demons, but these teachers pretend to be good. It is important to remember that "deceiving spirits" and "demons" refer to the same kind of evil spiritual being that rebels against God and tries to deceive and harm humans. Paul says that these teachers' consciences are "seared with a hot iron." Just like a hot iron can severely damage something, these teachers' consciences are affected so that the teachers no longer know the difference between right and wrong. Sometimes people use hot irons to make a mark on something to show that it belongs to them. Perhaps Paul means that Satan has made a mark on these false teachers, and now these false teachers belong completely to Satan. In any case, these teachers no longer understand that what they teach is wrong.

Stop here and discuss as a group: Look at a photo of an iron from Paul's time. How could you talk about someone who does not realize that what they teach is wrong? How will you talk about the teachers' consciences being seared with a hot iron? Pause this audio here.

It is important to know that food restrictions were a common problem in the church in those days. Paul is proving to Timothy that these laws on foods are wrong and do not have anything to do with the believers. Paul makes it clear to Timothy that everything God created is good, and that includes food. Before eating, believers are to pray and give thanks to God. Believers know the truth that God has made everything good. It is important to remember that when Paul says something is good, that thing is very good—it is excellent and beautiful! When believers pray and thank God, the believers should not hesitate to eat whatever is there because God blesses and makes the foods acceptable to God. In this passage, Paul says that the word of God and the prayers of believers make the food holy, or acceptable. Paul means that God speaks and says it is good. It is like God blesses the food!

Stop here and discuss as a group: How will you talk about how everything God created is good? Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. As you do this, think of the focus in each part of the passage. Have objects or persons to represent how Paul writes and how Timothy hears the letter. Put objects that represent each focus of each part of the passage between them. For focus one, represent how the Spirit speaks about how the believers turn away from God and follow the deceiving spirits and demons. In focus two, show how the false teachers follow the deceiving spirits happily and think that the teachers do good things. And in focus three, show how the false teachers forbid people to marry and eat certain foods. Show how believers pray and thank God, and how they get married and eat the food. Show how God says that everything is good!

Embodying the Text

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 4:1–5 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts, and each part has its focus.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* The Spirit
* The false teachers
* The believers

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul continues to tell Timothy, "The Spirit clearly says that in later times some people will abandon their faith in Jesus and they will follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the Spirit of God, "What are you thinking or feeling?" You may hear things like:

* I am sad that people follow the wrong thing. These people do not realise what they do! or
* I am angry at the demons for how they deceive people like this! The demons do not care about people, but I made these people! I love these people. These people are good!"

Paul says, "These teachers are hypocritical liars. The demons have seared these teachers' consciences with a hot iron."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the false teachers, "What are you thinking or feeling?" You may hear things like:

* I am not doing anything wrong. This teaching sounds right to me! or
* I am angry that Paul would say this about me! I know right from wrong! I am trying to help people, not hurt them!

Paul says, "They forbid people to marry and order people to abstain from certain foods."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the believers in the church at Ephesus, "What are you thinking or feeling?" You may hear things like:

* I do not like what these teachers are teaching! It seems hard to do! or
* This does not seem like God's teaching. God said everything he made was good. I am confused.

Paul says, "But God created people who believe in him and know the truth to receive all food with thanksgiving. Because everything God created is good, and people should not reject anything if they pray and thank God for it. Then God makes it holy, or acceptable to God."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the believers in the church at Ephesus, "What are you thinking or feeling?" You may hear things like:

* Oh! This makes sense now. This is what I learned originally when Paul first told us the good news; or
* God is so good! God can do anything. God even makes food holy!

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 4:1–5 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul says that the **Spirit** clearly says that some people will abandon the faith in the "later times." The Spirit is another name for the **Holy Spirit**. Use the same term for Spirit here as you have used in previous passages, and see the Master Glossary for more information about Holy Spirit.

Paul says that people will abandon, or turn away from, the **faith**. This means that people will no longer trust in and follow Jesus. Use the same word for faith that you used in previous passages, and remember that faith is in the Master Glossary.

Paul says that these people will follow deceiving **spirits** and **doctrines**, or teachings, of **demons**. Both spirits and demons refer to the same thing. These are evil supernatural beings whose purpose is to deceive people and turn those people away from God. Use the same word for doctrines, or teachings, as you used in previous passages, and look up doctrine in the Master Glossary, if needed.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will talk about **evil spirits** who deceive people, or **demons**. Look up demon and spirit in the Master Glossary for more information. Pause this audio here.

Paul says that the false teachers are **hypocrites** and liars, and that their **consciences** are damaged. This means these people can no longer understand the difference between right and wrong. Use the same word for conscience that you used in previous passages, and look up conscience in the Master Glossary for more information. Hypocrites pretend to do good things, but they are not really good.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will translate the idea that these teachers are **hypocrites** and liars. For more information, look up hypocrisy in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.

Paul says that believers can eat food if they thank God for it, because they **believe** and know the truth. Use the same word for believe that you have used in previous passages, and remember that belief is in the Master Glossary.

When God's people pray, and when God speaks through his **word**, God **consecrates**, or makes holy, the things God has made. When God makes something holy, God makes that thing acceptable for God's purposes. The food God created is good, and we can eat that food! Use the same word for pray as you have used in previous passages.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will talk about how God speaks through his **word** and how God **consecrates** things. For more information about the word of God and consecrate, see the Master Glossary. If you have used these words in other parts of the Bible, use the same words as you used there.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 4:6–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In the last passage, Paul was talking to Timothy, and he was telling him everything that Timothy needed to do about the problems in Timothy's church. Timothy's church was the church in Ephesus where Timothy was serving. Paul had sent Timothy there to serve the believers. And we know there were many problems in Timothy's church because there were people who were teaching false things. There were men and women in the church who were teaching that certain foods are bad for Christians to eat. They were teaching that marriage is bad. They were arguing over and over—they were arguing so much that when Paul talks about it, Paul says it is like they were arguing without stopping. And these people also told false stories about who was related to who, going back many, many, many years. And Paul says, "All this is foolish. It brings no good thing. It is just foolish."

In the passage before this, Paul has just told Timothy what Timothy needs to teach the believing men and women in his church. Paul calls these believing men and women "brothers and sisters," because it is like they are brothers and sisters in Christ. And Paul tells Timothy that Timothy should teach the believers in his church—the brothers and sisters—that it is prayer and it is the Word of God that makes food good for the Christian, and then makes marriage good for the Christian. Now, in this passage, Paul tells Timothy that doing this—teaching the brothers and sisters these true things about food and about marriage—will make Timothy a good servant of Christ Jesus. It will also make Timothy strong and well\-trained in all the things about Jesus that believers have believed, and it will make Timothy strong and well\-trained in the teaching that Timothy got from others. Paul talks about this in a way that will make the hearer think about raising up a child. When someone raises a child, they make the child strong, train the child, and give the child everything the child needs.

Stop here and discuss as a group: What do you need to do to raise up a child and make them strong and well\-trained? Pause this audio here.

Paul has just finished telling Timothy what Timothy needs to do to teach the believers in his church, and Paul has just told Timothy that doing this will make Timothy a good servant of Christ Jesus. It will make Timothy strong and well\-trained in all the things about Jesus that believers have believed, and it will make Timothy strong and well\-trained in the teaching that he got from others. Now Paul tells Timothy what Timothy should not do. Paul tells Timothy that he should not do this thing that the bad teachers are doing. If you remember, the bad teachers have been telling false stories, and they have been arguing. Paul tells Timothy that Timothy should not tell these same false stories or do this same foolish thing. Instead, Timothy should train himself to be godly. Paul makes the point that training the body is important, but training the self to be godly is very important. We know that Paul cared a lot about training the body. Paul talks about sports in many parts of the Bible, and Paul says that training as a Christian is like training as an athlete. You have to know what your goal is. You have to work hard. You have to try hard to be the best you can. Paul is saying that training the body is important, but training the self to be more like God, to be godly, is much more important. The reason Paul says this is that training the body is only good until you die. But training yourself to be godly brings a good thing while you are alive, and it brings a good thing in the life to come.

Stop here and discuss as a group: What does an athlete need to do to be strong and fast and ready to win? Pause this audio here.

Paul tells Timothy that training the self to be godly brings good things now and in the life to come. Paul tells Timothy that all of these things he has just said are true and that people should trust and accept these things Paul has said. Now Paul tells Timothy that the reason they work so hard is so that they will get this good thing, both now and in the life to come. When Paul says "they," Paul probably means himself and Timothy. So Paul says that they work hard to get the good thing now and the good thing in the life to come. And they do this because they have put their hope in the living God. This living God is the one who has saved all people. When Paul says "all people," Paul means all people who have believed in the good news about Jesus.

Defining the Scenes

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 4:6–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts, and each part has its focus.

**In the first part:** Paul tells Timothy something that Paul wants Timothy to do. Paul wants Timothy to teach believers in his church good things about food and about marriage. And Paul gives Timothy some extra information. Paul tells Timothy some good things that will come if Timothy does this.

**In part two:** Paul tells Timothy something he should not do. Timothy should not do what the bad teachers in his church have been doing. Then Paul tells Timothy something Timothy should do instead. Timothy should train himself to be godly. And then Paul tells Timothy reasons why this is a good thing.

**In part three:** Paul reminds Timothy why he and Timothy work so hard. Paul reminds him that the reason they work so hard is because they put their hope in the living God. Paul tells Timothy that this living God is the one who has saved all people. And when Paul says "all people," Paul means all people who have believed.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* the living God
* And all people who have believed

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passages:

In part one, Paul tells Timothy what he wants him to do, and then Paul immediately gives Timothy reasons why he wants him to do that. Paul tells Timothy good things that he thinks will come if Timothy does what he wants Timothy to do.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How would you communicate to someone listening that there are good things that will come if they do what you tell them to do? Pause this audio here.

Now, in part two, Paul tells Timothy something Timothy should not do. Timothy should not do what the bad teachers in his church have been doing. And he immediately tells Timothy a good thing that he should do. Timothy should train himself to be godly. Now, as soon as Paul tells Timothy that he should train himself to be godly, Paul starts to give Timothy more information so that Timothy will know why he should do this. Paul tells Timothy that training the body is good. This is something Timothy knows. But then Paul tells him that training to be godly is even more important. Paul follows this by saying something very important: Paul makes it clear that all of this is not something that Paul is saying for the first time. This is something that Paul has heard other people say many, many times. Paul has heard people say this. Paul knows Timothy has heard people say this. And Paul wants Timothy to think about this.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How would you make it clear to someone listening that you are sharing words that other people have said many times before? Pause this audio here.

Now, it seems important also to say that Paul often says the words that other people have said many times. Paul does this in many other letters that he writes, and Paul usually says something to make it clear that this is something that other people have said many times. When Paul does this, it is often at a very important part of Paul's letter that he really wants someone to listen to.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How would you make it clear to a listener that a certain part of what you say is the most important part for them to hear? Pause this audio here.

Now, in the third part of this passage, Paul reminds Timothy that the reason Paul and Timothy work so hard to train themselves to be godly is that they have put their hope in the living God. Paul makes it clear that this living God is the God who has saved all people. And Paul also makes it clear that "all people" means all people who have believed.

Now the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts, and each part has its focus.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* the living God
* And all people who have believed

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plot line, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the characters should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Act out how Paul tells Timothy that Timothy is a good servant of Christ Jesus, because he has just taught good things about food and about marriage. Now act out how Timothy is strong and well\-trained in the things that believers believe about Jesus and in the teaching that Timothy received.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Timothy, "What are you thinking or feeling?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel happy because I am a good servant! or
* I feel frustrated because people believe bad things.

Now act out how Timothy trains his body to be strong. Act out how Paul tells Timothy that this is good only until Timothy dies. Now act out how Timothy trains himself to be godly. Act out how Paul tells Timothy that this will be good now and in the life to come. Act out how Paul tells Timothy that many people have said this and Timothy should believe this.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you thinking or feeling?" The person might answer things like:

* I hope Timothy believes this; or
* I want Timothy to use his life to do a good thing.

Act out how people put their hope in the living God. Act out how Paul tells Timothy that he and Timothy should work very hard. Now act out how Paul and Timothy put their hope in the living God.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you thinking or feeling?" The person might answer things like:

* I hope that Timothy will feel encouraged to do the work; or
* I am thankful that the living God has saved us because we believe in him.

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 4:6–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

In the beginning of this passage, Paul talks to Timothy and he tells Timothy something important about **brothers and sisters** in his church. Now, in the language that Paul and Timothy speak, they will often say "brothers" when they're talking about a group of men and women. This is why some translations will say "brothers and sisters," and some translations will say "brothers." It is okay to translate this in whatever way makes sense in your language.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for "brothers and sisters." If you have already translated this word in another book in the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul tells Timothy that if Timothy teaches good things to the brothers and sisters, then he will be a good **servant** of Christ Jesus. A servant is someone who serves. Now, in some church traditions, people have a special title for "serving" that they use to talk about those who have a special job of serving in the church. This is not the job that Timothy had. Timothy was a servant of the church because Timothy did things to serve the church. But there is reason to believe that Timothy had a different role in the church, and he did not have the special job of a servant with that special title that some church traditions use.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **servant**. For more information, look up servant in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul tells Timothy that Timothy should not pay attention to **false stories**, and Timothy should not do this thing that the bad teachers have been doing. Some translations talk about this in a way that uses a special word for these false stories. These false stories are made up stories—stories that are not true—usually about things that have happened a long time ago.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for "false stories." If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul tells Timothy that instead of doing what the bad teachers do, Timothy should train himself for **godliness**. Godliness is being like God—having the same kind of character as God. You are godly both inside yourself and also to show the rest of the world that you are like God in your character and in the way that you act and the way that you think.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **godliness**. Use the same word for godliness that you have used in the previous passages, and look up godly in the Master Glossary for more information. Pause this audio here.

Finally, Paul tells Timothy the reason that Paul and Timothy work so hard to get the good thing that comes from training themselves to be godly. Paul and Timothy do this because he and Timothy have put their **hope** in the living God. Use the same word for hope that you have used in previous passages, and refer to hope in the Master Glossary for more information. Paul tells Timothy that this living God is the **savior**, or the one who has saved **all people**. And it is clear that when Paul says "all people," Paul means all people who have believed. Some translations will talk about this in a way that makes it clear what Paul says. It is important to know that Paul says "the living God who saved all people." Some translations will have a word that means especially, or particularly, those who believed. This makes it clear that when Paul says "all people," what Paul has in mind is the people who have believed in the good news about Jesus. Use the same word for savior that you have used in previous passages, and refer to the Master Glossary for more information about savior.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for "all people, especially those who believe." If you have already translated this phrase in another book of the Bible, use the same phrase that you have used there. For more information, you can look up believer in the Master Glossary.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 4:11–16 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

Timothy was probably under 40 years old. In the culture of that time, people expected younger people to follow older people, not to lead older people. We have seen Paul consistently encourage Timothy to do the things God has called Timothy to do. You may remember that Paul encouraged the Corinthian church to accept Timothy when Timothy came and to respect Timothy's teaching. Here, Paul encourages Timothy to continue Timothy's work in Ephesus. Timothy faced difficult challenges as a young leader in the church at Ephesus. Some church members were older than Timothy, and these people did not want to accept Timothy's authority. The people in Ephesus needed to respect Timothy, because Timothy did God's work, just like Paul.

The church in Ephesus struggled with several problems that made it more difficult for Timothy to lead. You will remember that some wealthy women disrupted worship when they wore expensive clothes and jewelry. Some church leaders taught things that did not agree with Paul's teaching. People argued about what foods believers could eat and whether the believers should get married. These problems made Timothy's job harder, especially since some people questioned Timothy's right to lead because of Timothy's age.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about a time when you had to lead people who were older or more experienced than you. What challenges did you face? How did you handle those challenges? Pause this audio here.

Paul tells Timothy to command and teach all of the important things that Paul has just told Timothy about. Timothy must tell people that everything God created is good. Timothy must teach believers to stay away from false stories that are not true. Timothy must help believers understand how to live in a way that honors God.

Paul wants Timothy to be an example for other believers in every way. Timothy should watch how he talks. Timothy's words should be truthful and helpful. Timothy should be careful about how he behaves. Timothy's actions should show others what following Jesus looks like. Timothy should show love to others. This means Timothy should serve people and care about those peoples' needs. Timothy should show strong faith in God. This means Timothy should trust God even when it is difficult to lead. Timothy should keep himself pure. This especially means Timothy should build relationships wisely and stay sexually pure. Timothy should know who to trust and how to interact with different people in the church. If Timothy lives this way, people will not focus on Timothy's age but will respect Timothy as a leader.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Describe someone who is a good example of trusting Jesus. What specific things did that person do that showed their faith in Jesus was real? Pause this audio here.

Paul gives Timothy practical advice for how Timothy should lead while Paul is away. First, Timothy needs to read Scripture out loud to everyone. In Timothy's time, when leaders read Scripture, the leaders usually read the Jewish books of religious law and prophets that translators had written in the Greek language. The Jews read from these books in a three\-year cycle, and they would read sections from these books each time the Jews met. The way the people read Scripture regularly was very important because it taught people what God had done throughout history. This reading also helped the church understand how Jesus fulfilled the promises God had made to his people throughout history. Just as God's people had always gathered to hear religious leaders read Scripture, the church in Ephesus needed to continue this practice.

Second, Timothy needs to encourage the believers by preaching. When leaders preached, they helped people understand how to live according to God's word, or Scripture. Leaders explained what the Scriptures meant and how to apply the Scriptures to peoples' lives. Timothy needed to devote himself to the teaching of Scripture, or doctrine. Timothy needed to make sure that the things he preached were correct and good. Timothy needed to explain the truth about Jesus and correct false ideas.

Some time before, God had given someone a special message, or prophecy, that God was giving Timothy the spiritual gift to serve as a leader in God's church. The church leaders laid their hands on Timothy and prayed for him. When people laid their hands on Timothy in this ceremony, it was a visible sign that God had already given Timothy special abilities to lead. The ceremony itself did not give Timothy these abilities. The church leaders placed their hands on Timothy to show everyone that they saw God's work in Timothy's life and that the leaders approved Timothy for this important work. This ceremony was similar to how people recognized leaders in the Jewish faith also. Timothy must not ignore this gift but should keep using it.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about a time when others recognized a gift or ability in you that you did not see in yourself. How did the encouragement that those people gave you help you to use that gift? Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about how your community supports people who take on new responsibilities to serve others. What makes this support important? Consider the specific ways your community members show confidence in those who God has called to serve the church. What does your community do to help new leaders feel ready to serve? Pause this audio here.

Paul tells Timothy to consistently do the things Paul has taught Timothy. Timothy must pay attention to how he lives and what he teaches. Timothy needs to make sure his actions match his teaching so that Timothy will not be like the hypocrites and liars of the previous passage. Timothy should prepare before he teaches Scripture to others. When Timothy preaches, he needs to think carefully about how to encourage the believers. Timothy must be careful to keep developing the gift God gave Timothy for ministry. Timothy should not let other activities distract him from his main work. Timothy should take time to study Scripture. Timothy should think carefully about how to be a good example to others. When Timothy does these things faithfully and consistently, other people will see Timothy grow more and more as a leader. As a result, both Timothy and the people who listen to Timothy understand more and more how God saves people through Jesus. When Jesus came to earth to restore our relationship with God, God made it possible for people to live forever with him. But God, through Jesus, even now, gives people power to live in new ways that please God. God helps people understand his truth more clearly. God works in people to make them more like Jesus. When Timothy teaches well and follows what he teaches, Timothy himself and the whole church will grow in understanding how God's salvation works in their lives today and forever.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time you or someone else continued to serve God faithfully, even when it was difficult. When you or this person persevered, how did it affect the people around you? How did it help them grow in their faith?

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 4:11–16 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has four parts.

**In the first part:** Paul tells Timothy to command and teach what Paul has just explained.

**In the second part:** Paul tells Timothy not to let anyone look down on Timothy because he is young. Timothy should be an example for other believers.

**In the third part:** Paul tells Timothy that Timothy's focus should be to read Scripture in public, to preach, and to teach until Paul arrives.

**In the fourth part:** Paul reminds Timothy about Timothy's special gift, and Paul tells Timothy to be careful about how he lives and what he teaches.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* The believers
* The church elders
* The prophets who spoke about Timothy
* God
* And the Holy Spirit

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Paul has just finished explaining how Christians should think about food and exercise. Paul said that physical exercise helps the body. But training to be godly helps both now and in the future life with God. Now Paul tells Timothy how to share these important truths with others.

When Paul writes to Timothy, Paul writes in a way that would be easy to remember and repeat. Paul arranges his ideas in clear patterns. Paul uses examples from everyday life. Paul connects new teachings to things the believers already know from Scripture. Paul wants Timothy to teach these same ideas to others in ways they can understand and remember.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What helps you remember important teachings? Do you learn better through stories, songs, or other methods? Pause this audio here.

Timothy faces a challenge in his work for God. Timothy is younger than many people in the church. Members of the church in Ephesus refused to accept Timothy as their leader. In fact, Paul uses words in his letter to show that these church members treated Timothy with deep disrespect. Paul wants Timothy to be confident despite this problem. Timothy can earn respect when he acts as an example in five important ways:

* First, Timothy should make sure his speech shows maturity and matches what Timothy teaches about God. In other words, Timothy's words should be consistent with Timothy's godly way of life. Timothy should be godly in both his regular conversations and when he teaches in the church.
* Second, Timothy should be careful about how Timothy behaves.
* Third, Timothy should show love to everyone.
* Fourth, Timothy should trust God strongly and show this strong trust to others.
* Fifth, Timothy should stay sexually pure, especially as a young man. People watch Timothy closely and might criticize Timothy's youth. But Timothy can make his critics stop criticizing him if Timothy lives a sexually pure life.

When Timothy does these five things well, people will respect Timothy regardless of his age.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about a time when someone really did not respect someone else because that person was young. How would you talk about how these people do not respect this person, or how the people treat this person like the person is worthless? Pause this audio here.

Paul gives Timothy specific instructions about how to lead church meetings. When believers gather together, Timothy should read Scripture out loud. This practice comes from Jewish worship. This practice helps everyone hear and understand Scripture together.

Timothy should also preach messages that encourage people to live better lives and that comfort people. These messages help people understand how to follow God's ways. Finally, Timothy should be sure that Timothy's teaching, or doctrine, is good. Timothy should explain the important things that Christians believe in a correct way. This teaching helps protect people from false ideas about God.

Stop here and discuss as a group: Can you give examples of how people in your church preach, and how people in your church teach good teaching? Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss as a group: How will you talk about how Timothy should preach or encourage people, and how Timothy should teach things that are true and correct? Paul says that Timothy should not just do these things, but Timothy should devote himself to doing these things. In other words, Timothy should spend time to make sure Timothy does these things well. How will you make that clear? Pause this audio here.

God prepared Timothy for this important work. God gave Timothy a special gift to help Timothy lead and teach. The church leaders recognized this gift from God. The leaders showed their recognition through a special ceremony. The leaders put their hands on Timothy while prophets shared messages from God about Timothy. This ceremony showed everyone that God chose Timothy as a leader. It gave Timothy authority to teach God's word.

Paul warns Timothy to pay careful attention to two things. First, Timothy must watch how he lives. Every choice Timothy makes should honor God. People will watch Timothy's life to see if Timothy follows his own teaching. Second, Timothy must be careful about what he teaches. Timothy should only teach what agrees with God's word. Timothy should stay faithful to both good living and true teaching every day. Timothy should not give up when people make this hard. Timothy must keep going even when others resist Timothy. Timothy's continuing effort in both these tasks will make a real difference. Timothy's faithful life and teaching will help both himself and others follow God better.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Timothy needs to "watch his life," or pay attention to how he lives. How will you talk about how Timothy watches his life? Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. Draw or use an object to represent how Timothy teaches while older people show disapproval. Show how church leaders place their hands on Timothy during a special ceremony. Show how Timothy reads Scripture to a group. Use simple objects like a mirror to show how Timothy watches his life and what he teaches. Create a scene to show how Timothy helps someone while he also teaches that person. Show how Timothy continues to teach and live faithfully over time.

This passage has four parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* The believers
* The church elders
* The prophets who spoke about Timothy
* God
* And the Holy Spirit

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "Timothy, command and teach these things. Make sure the believers understand and follow these truths about godliness and right living that I have just explained to you."

* I want to be as clear and strong in my teaching as Paul is; or
* God's truth deserves to be taught with confidence.

Paul says, "Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young. Instead, be an example for all the believers. Show the believers how to live by the way you speak, the way you live, your love, your faith, and your pure life."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* Sometimes I feel so alone as I try to lead people who are much older than me; or
* I get discouraged when people focus on my age instead of God's gift in me; or
* I feel frustrated when people refuse to listen, even though God clearly called me to teach; or
* I want to show deep faith in God, but sometimes I feel scared and uncertain.

Ask the person who plays the believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* Timothy's example shows us that Timothy is mature despite his age; or
* We can learn from how Timothy lives his life; or
* Timothy's actions match his teaching.

Paul says, "Until I come back, focus on three things: read Scripture aloud to the people, preach messages that encourage the people, and teach the people what is true."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* These three tasks give me a clear way to serve the church; or
* Reading God's word publicly helps everyone learn together; or
* Sometimes I worry that I am not explaining God's Word clearly enough.

Ask the person who plays the believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* When we hear Timothy read Scripture, it helps us understand God's word; or
* Timothy's preaching encourages us to live better lives; or
* Timothy's teaching helps us know what is true; or
* We need all these things to grow in faith.

Paul says, "Do not neglect your gift, which you received when the elders laid their hands on you and the prophets spoke God's message about you. Be diligent in these matters. Give yourself completely to these things so everyone can see your progress. Watch your life and teaching carefully. Keep doing these things, because they will help save both you and those who hear you."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the church elders, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* We remember when God confirmed Timothy's gift through the prophets; or
* We are glad we supported Timothy when we laid hands on him; or
* God clearly chose Timothy for this work.

Ask the person who plays Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* It is exhausting to keep up with all these duties, especially when people resist; or
* What I do and what I teach need to match; or
* God can use me to help others find salvation; or
* I feel encouraged when I remember that special moment with the elders.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 4:11–16 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul mentions that Timothy should be an example to the **believers** in faith and purity. Believers are people who trust in Jesus Christ. These people accept God's message as true and follow Jesus as their leader. A believer belongs to the community of Christians who worship God together.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **believers**. How does your culture describe people who trust in God and follow Jesus? Look up believers in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

**Faith** means to trust God and believe his promises. Faith also means the set of beliefs that Christians hold to be true. For more information on faith, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for faith as you used in previous passages.

Paul tells Timothy to show others how to live a **pure** life. Pure means free from anything morally wrong or sinful. A pure life shows clean and honest behavior. This especially refers to being sexually pure and having honest motives. Timothy needs to live purely so others will respect Timothy's leadership.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **pure**. How does your culture describe someone who lives a morally clean and honest life? Look up pure in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul tells Timothy to focus on reading **Scripture** in public. Scripture refers to the holy writings that God inspired people to write. In Timothy's time, the word "Scripture" meant what we now call the Old Testament. The early church would read these Scriptures out loud when they met together.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **Scripture**. Look up Scripture in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul reminds Timothy about Timothy's spiritual **gift**. A spiritual gift comes from God's Spirit. God gives these gifts to help Christians serve others and build up the church. God gave Timothy a special ability to teach and lead the church.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for spiritual **gift**. How does your culture describe special abilities that God gives to people? How do you talk about gifts that come from God's Spirit? Look up gift in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Timothy received his gift through **prophecy**. To prophesy means to speak messages that come directly from God. In this case, God spoke through prophets to confirm that Timothy should be a leader in the church. Use the same word you used previously in 1 Timothy for prophecy. For more information on prophecy, refer to the Master Glossary.

The **elders** laid their hands on Timothy. Elders are the older, respected leaders who guide the church. The elders have authority to make decisions and teach God's truth. In this passage, the elders officially showed that they recognized Timothy's role when they laid their hands on Timothy.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **elders**. How does your culture describe respected leaders who guide the community? If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul tells Timothy to watch his life and **doctrine** carefully. Doctrine means the important teachings about God and what Christians should believe. Good doctrine helps people understand the truth and recognize false teaching. For more information on doctrine, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word for doctrine that you used in previous passages.

Paul tells Timothy that Timothy's faithful service will **save** himself and others. God saves people when he rescues people from sin and the consequences of sin. God saves people when those people trust in Jesus Christ. This salvation begins now and continues forever. God uses faithful teachers like Timothy to help bring this salvation to others. Use the same word for save as you have used in previous passages, and look up salvation in the Master Glossary for more information.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 5:1–8 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this passage, Paul continues to tell Timothy how he can be a good teacher, even though Timothy is younger than many people in his church. Paul then begins to tell Timothy how to deal with a specific problem in the Ephesian church. This first part is closely connected to the last passage, where Paul encouraged Timothy to stay strong and true to Timothy's calling from God to be a teacher of the good news.

In some passages of this letter, when Paul talks about leaders, Paul uses a word for older people to refer to these leaders. But in this passage, Paul still focuses on the role Timothy has as a leader to everyone in his church. In this context, Paul uses the word for older people to mean any person in the church older than Timothy, not just those who are leaders. Paul discusses four different groups of people: men older than Timothy, men younger than Timothy, women older than Timothy, and women younger than Timothy. Paul wants Timothy to respect and communicate with all of these groups of people in the right way. Paul uses a comparison to family to give Timothy an idea of the different ways to lead and correct people of different ages and genders. Paul says Timothy should treat older men and women as his father and mother, and younger people like he would treat his brothers or sisters.

We know a few things about Timothy's family from Paul's second letter to Timothy as well as from the book of Acts. We know that Timothy's grandmother was named Lois and his mother was named Eunice. We also know from Acts that Eunice was Jewish and read the Old Testament, or Jewish Scriptures, to Timothy when Timothy was still a child. Timothy's father, however, was Greek, and probably pagan. By the time Paul met Timothy's family, Lois, Eunice, and Timothy had all begun to follow Jesus. However, no passage in the Bible tells us about Timothy's sisters or brothers. That does not mean Timothy did not have any sisters or brothers. We do not know if Timothy did or did not have brothers or sisters. Regardless, family relationships are a good comparison, because everyone can easily understand them. For example, even if Timothy did not have a younger sister, Timothy would know how to treat a sister and Timothy would understand how Paul wanted Timothy to treat church members who were younger women.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do people in your community treat parents, sisters, and brothers with respect and love? Tell a story about a time when a younger person had to correct an older person. Notice the words you use to talk about these relationships and the difference between age and gender. Pause this audio here.

In the second part of this passage, Paul changes his focus when he begins to instruct Timothy on how to deal with challenges regarding how the church cares for widows. For the rest of his letter, Paul will talk about several specific problems that Timothy has to deal with as leader of the Ephesian church. Since Paul just talked about older and younger women, Paul naturally changes to this new focus when he talks about some challenges with helping widows.

A widow is a woman whose husband has died. In ancient Greek society, this left a woman in a very difficult situation financially and socially. Under Greek law, women had few rights. The men in women's lives totally controlled the women's financial and social lives. Because of these laws and customs, if a woman lost her father or husband, her brothers or sons were responsible for her. If the woman's brothers or sons refused, or were unable to help her, then the woman had no way to support herself financially or take part safely in Ephesian society. Paul says that if a widow has children or grandchildren, then the children or grandchildren should take care of the widow. Paul says this is a godly way to live, and to live like this pleases God.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do customs or laws in your community help widows? What customs or laws make life harder for the widows? How does your church care for people in your community who are at a disadvantage legally, financially, or socially? If widows are one of these groups, share a story about a time your church helped a widow. Pause this audio here.

Paul ends this passage when he warns about the wrong witness widows or their families can give to the rest of society. Paul just said that a widow who has no one to help her trusts God. On the other hand, widows who live for pleasure do not truly live anymore. To live for pleasure does not mean that pleasure is bad, but that pleasure and enjoyment should not be the focus of the widows' lives. Now Paul condemns Christians who do not take care of their own family. Paul speaks broadly about family when he says that any believers who do not care for the people in their families are not just bad, but even worse than the nonbelievers in Ephesus.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: If a person lives in a way that shows that the person only wants to have pleasure and not do any good for the community, how do you describe that lifestyle or that person? Think about fables or proverbs in your language that warn against this way to live. Pause this audio here.

Between the warnings to widows and to their families, Paul speaks to Timothy directly and tells Timothy to instruct these church members in this way so that others cannot find fault with any church members. Paul is concerned for the reputation of the Church. Paul will speak specifically about this more in the next passage. Throughout this letter, Paul tells his concern for how the non\-believing community sees the Church, especially as Paul instructs Timothy how to deal with sin and difficult situations among believers.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What are ways that people can damage their reputation in your community? How does this affect the way the person takes part in society?

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 5:1–8 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has two parts.

**In the first part:** Paul instructs Timothy how to discipline the people in the Ephesian church. Paul uses family relationships as a comparison for how Timothy should respect and communicate with all of the believers in the right way.

**In the second part:** Paul changes focus to instruct Timothy on how to deal with challenges regarding how the church cares for widows and how people in the church should take care of their own families.

The characters in this passage are:

* God
* Paul
* Timothy
* Older men
* Younger men
* Older women
* Younger women
* Widows who really need the church's help
* Widows who misuse the church's help
* Children or other relatives of widows or parents in need—some of these family members help the widows and some do not
* And people in Ephesus who are not believers

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In this passage, Paul continues to tell Timothy how Timothy can be a good teacher, despite the fact that Timothy is young. This first part is closely connected to the last passage, where Paul encouraged Timothy to stay strong and true to his calling from God to be a teacher of the good news. However, Paul encourages Timothy to teach in a way that is respectful to all ages and genders. So, in this first part, Paul talks about four different groups of people: men older than Timothy, men younger than Timothy, women older than Timothy, and women younger than Timothy. Paul wants Timothy to respect people who are older. Paul tells Timothy to treat and encourage the older men and women as he would Timothy's father or mother. Paul also wants Timothy to show the right kind of respect and love for the people younger than Timothy. Again, Paul uses a comparison to family. Paul wants Timothy to treat younger people like he would treat his brothers or sisters. Specifically, Timothy should treat the younger women in purity, which means that Timothy should be sexually pure when he interacts with younger women.

Stop here and discuss the different people who lead in your churches. How do these people correct and minister to people of different ages and genders differently? Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will talk about the four groups of people: older and younger men, and older and younger women. What words do you have in your language to talk about these groups of people? Pause this audio here.

In the second part of this passage, Paul changes his focus. For the rest of Paul's letter, Paul will talk about several specific problems that Timothy has to deal with in the Ephesian church, including corrupt and greedy leaders, as well as people in difficult social situations like widows and slaves. Since Paul just talked about older and younger women, Paul naturally changes to this new focus when he talks about some challenges with helping widows. A widow is a woman whose husband has died. In ancient Greek society, this left the woman in a very difficult situation financially and socially. When Paul says these women are truly widows, Paul does not mean these women's husbands really are dead. All of these widows really do have dead husbands. What Paul means is these women really are in need of help. Paul insists that if a widow has children or grandchildren, those children or grandchildren should take care of the widow. Here, Paul now talks about real family. Paul is not making a comparison. Paul says this is a godly way for families to live and that it pleases God.

Stop here and discuss children's responsibilities to their parents in your community. How do people respect and care for their parents in your community? What makes people want to do this? Pause this audio here.

Paul then adds that the kind of widow the church should help is not only one who is truly without family, but also one who is a true believer. This kind of widow trusts God and prays. When Paul says that the widow prays "night and day," Paul does not mean that she actually prays without stopping and does nothing else. In fact, in the next passage, Paul will write about the many important ministries that widows had in the Ephesian church. The phrase "night and day" means that the widow prays very regularly and often.

Stop here and discuss things that you do regularly and often to worship or connect with God. Pay attention to the kind of language you use to express a habit that you do frequently. Do you exaggerate with phrases like "all day long," or phrases like "night and day," or maybe "day and night?" Use whatever phrase is natural in your language. Pause this audio here.

Paul ends this passage with warnings against widows who live for pleasure and families who do not care for each other. Paul uses strong language to condemn both these groups. Widows who live life just to please themselves live the wrong way. Paul says these widows are already dead. Paul exaggerates when he says this. Paul means that the kind of life these widows live is such a bad way to live that it is like the widows are dead already. When Paul condemns these widows, Paul does not mean that everything enjoyable is bad. The word for pleasure here means to want only what feels good and to want too much of it.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will talk about how these widows are already "dead," even though the widows are not really dead. How will you show that this is an exaggeration? Pause this audio here.

Paul also speaks strongly against believers who do not take care of the people in their families. Paul says these believers deny what they say they believe about God and are even worse than the nonbelievers in Ephesus. This is not an exaggeration. Paul means exactly what Paul says.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do people in your community view people who live a purposeless life? How do people view those who do not help their families when their families need them? Pay attention to how you might use either direct language or exaggeration to make statements in which you judge people who act wrongly. Pause this audio here.

Between the warnings to widows and to their families, Paul says to Timothy that Timothy should instruct these church members in this way so that others cannot find fault with the church members. We find Paul's concern for how the non\-believing community sees the Church throughout this letter. We see this theme at the beginning, when Paul instructs Timothy to pray for all people to be saved, and when he instructs Timothy how to deal with some problems during prayer and worship meetings. Paul will repeat this theme in the next passage, and again when he teaches about slaves. Paul instructs Timothy how to deal with sin in the church and how the believers can live through unjust social situations. As Paul does this, Paul's main concern is that the people in the church are able to tell the good news about Jesus to all people so that all people can be saved.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How might the way a person acts affect how the community feels about that person's religion? Share stories about times when your own sin made it difficult for you to share the good news with someone. You can also retell stories from the Bible where God's people failed and gave nonbelievers a reason not to believe in God. As you tell the stories, pay attention to how you are able to follow the theme throughout the story. Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. You may choose to divide people or objects into different groups. Be sure that you show how some Ephesians who are not members of the church look in to see what is happening. First, show that Timothy corrects older and younger men, and older and younger women in the church respectfully and with love. Then, Timothy turns to the women in the church. The women should divide into widows and non\-widows. The widows should further divide into widows who have help from their families and widows who do not have help. Move the widows who have families next to their families. Show that some families do not help the widows. Move the widows who do not have families next to the other members of the church to show that the church takes care of these widows. Now show how the widows look towards God for their help. Show that the Ephesians who are not part of the church look in and see that the church members take care of each other.

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 5:1–8 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has two parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* God
* Paul
* Timothy
* Older men
* Younger men
* Older women
* Younger women
* Widows who really need the church's help
* Widows who misuse the church's help
* Children or other relatives of widows or parents in need—some of these family members help the widows and some do not
* And people in Ephesus who are not believers

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Act out how Timothy gives instructions to the four groups of people, with one person to represent each group: an older man, a younger man, an older woman, and a younger woman.

Pause the drama.

Ask one of the people who plays the church members, "What are you feeling as Timothy corrects and teaches you, even though he is older or younger than you?" The person might answer things like:

* It is difficult to be corrected by a younger person, but I appreciate how he is kind when he speaks.

Act out both a widow who has family and a widow who has no family. Have the widow who is alone act out praying to God. Have the family of the first widow act out how they help that widow.

Pause the drama.

Ask one of the children, "What are you feeling as you help your mother?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel that God is pleased when I help my mother.

Ask the widow who is alone, "What are you feeling right now?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel close to God, even though I have no family.

Have a third widow act out living only for pleasure. Have the widow with children act again, but this time the children ignore the widow's needs.

Pause the drama.

Ask the third widow, "What are you feeling right now?" The person might answer things like:

* I do not think about family or God anymore, but I still feel very alone.

Ask the widow with children who ignore her, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am so sad that my children do not care about me. I will try to look to God to help me.

Now have Timothy instruct both of them to behave differently so that people outside the church will not be able to criticize them.

Pause the drama.

Ask Timothy, "What are you feeling?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel concerned that nonbelievers will not want to listen to us when we try to tell them about the good news of Jesus.

Ask the person playing the people in Ephesus who are not believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like

* I'm going to watch to see if the Christians really love each other or not. If not, then it proves that what they believe is wrong! or
* I am curious about how the Christians take care of each other. I want something like that.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 5:1–8 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul commands Timothy to treat the younger women in all **purity**. Purity means to be innocent or clean in a spiritual sense. In this context, purity also refers to the right kind of relationship between a man and woman who are not married to each other. Use the same word for pure or purity as you used in previous passages. Look up pure in the Master Glossary for more information.

Paul says that believers can first show their devotion to God, or **godliness**, in how they take care of the widows in their own families. **Godly** means that people live life in a way that pleases God. This shows peoples' respect for God. Use the same word or phrase for godly as you used in previous passages. Look up godly in the Master Glossary for more information.

Paul describes the kind of widow the church should help as a widow who puts her **hope** in God. To hope means to believe in the promises of God and a good future because one follows Jesus. Use the same word or phrase for hope as you used in previous passages. Look up hope in the Master Glossary for more information.

Paul also describes the kind of widow the church should help as one who continually tells her requests and prayers to God. A **request** is something that a person asks God to do for that person. A **prayer** is a more general word that means to talk to God. Use the same words or phrases for requests and prayers as you used in previous passages. Look up pray in the Master Glossary for more information.

Paul says that when someone does not care for a member of that person's family, or **household**, these family members have denied the **faith**. Paul means that these people no longer believe or have faith in Jesus and the good news that Jesus is the Savior. Use the same words or phrases for household and faith as you used in previous passages. Look up household and faith in the Master Glossary for more information.

Paul compares family members who do not take care of each other to **unbelievers**. Unbelievers are people who do not believe in the faith. In other words, these people do not believe the good news.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **nonbelievers**. Look up believer and belief in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 5:9–16 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

It is important to remember that this section of Paul's letter connects to the previous section. In the last section, Paul begins to talk about the ways the church should care for people in the church. Paul specifically mentions those who are truly widows, and Paul encourages families to care for their widowed family members. In this section, Paul continues to talk about caring for widows. This section ends with a similar instruction for women to care for the widows in their family, so that the church can care for those who are truly widows. When Paul says that a woman is truly a widow, Paul talks about widows who have no one to care for them.

In this section of the letter, Paul begins by telling Timothy what kind of widows the church is supposed to care for. Paul says the church should add these widows to an official list of widows who need ongoing help. Paul gives three requirements for when the church should add these widows.

First, the widow needs to be at least 60 years old. At 60 years old, a widow would probably not get remarried, so the widow would need help to care for herself.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What kinds of things do you think these older widows might need help with? Pause this audio here.

Second, Paul says the widow needs to be the wife of one husband. Paul means that, just like the overseers and deacons, the widow needs to have been faithful in her marriage. This means that the widow was married to only one man and did not have sexual relations with other men while she was married.

Third, Paul says when people think of the widow, they should think of the widow's good works.

And then Paul gives examples of what these good works could be.

First, the widow should have raised her children well and cared for the children physically and spiritually.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What kinds of things do women who raise their children well do? Tell a story of parents you know who have raised their children well. Pause this audio here.

Second, the widow should also have shown hospitality to others. The widow should have been willing to feed guests and even invite the guests to stay in her home. This is the same requirement that Paul has for elders and deacons earlier in 1 Timothy.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What kinds of things does someone who shows hospitality do? Tell a story of a time someone showed hospitality. Pause this audio here.

Third, as part of showing hospitality, the widow should have washed the feet of other saints, or other Christians. To wash the feet of other people was a common way to show hospitality to guests. Because everyone wore sandals and traveled on dirt roads, the same roads that animals also walked along, people had to wash their feet before they went into someone's house. At that time, only servants and some women washed other people's feet. To wash someone's feet was an act of humble service. Jesus himself washed the feet of his disciples and told them that they should do the same thing for each other. Therefore, to wash someone's feet became a symbol of humble service that Christians should show one another.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your community, if one person washed another person's feet, how would that second person react? What are some ways that people show humble service and hospitality to each other? Pause this audio here.

Finally, Paul says the widow should have helped those who were in trouble.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What are other good works that people can do to show that they are godly? Pause this audio here.

Next, Paul talks about the widows who should *not* be added to that list. Paul says that young widows should not be on this list. This is because, if their sexual desires ever overcome their desire to follow Christ, then these widows will want to marry someone. When the widows marry that person, God will judge the widows because they have rejected their first faith, or stopped following God. It is important to know that Paul is *not* telling these younger widows that they cannot get remarried. In fact, he even encourages them to get remarried later in this passage. Paul is also not saying that sexual desires are wrong in themselves. Instead, Paul is talking about a sexual desire that leads the women away from Christ. Perhaps Paul is thinking of a situation where the widow no longer wants to be alone and instead wants to be married again. And because of this desire, she marries someone who is not a Christian. In this case, the widow's desires have led her away from Christ and her faith.

Paul also goes on to say that if the church did add these young widows to the list, the widows would learn to be lazy instead of to work for themselves. The widows might travel around and talk negatively about others and get involved in other people's business in ways they should not.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How does gossip, or talking badly about others, cause problems in a community? Pause this audio here.

Instead, Paul says these young widows should marry someone. The widows should have children and take care of their families and their homes. If the widows live this way, people will see the widows' good works and no one will be able to speak evil things about the widows. In this passage, Paul wants to emphasize that it is important to have a good reputation in the community. People should know you for your good works. Paul then adds a warning that some young widows have already stopped following Jesus and followed Satan's ways instead.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell us about a woman you know who other people know for her good works. What does the woman do? Why do people say the woman is a good person? Pause this audio here.

Finally, Paul tells women in the church that if the women have relatives who are widows, the relatives should take care of the widows. If families care for their own widows, the church will not have to care for them. Then the church can take care of those who do not have help.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How have you seen the church care for people who need help? Pause this audio here.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 5:9–16 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul describes the widows who the church should add to the official list of widows who need help from the church.

**In the second part:** In the second scene, Paul describes the younger widows who the church should not add to the list. Paul describes some of the dangers these younger widows face and instead encourages the widows to live out a godly life as a wife and mother. And Paul warns that some young widows have already followed after Satan.

**In the third part:** Paul tells women to care for the widows in their family so the church can care for the widows who do not have a family.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Members of the church
* People in the community who are not believers
* Widows who the church should add to the list
* Younger widows who leave the faith
* Younger widows who live a godly life
* New husbands and household members
* Jesus Christ
* Satan
* Widows who have family to help them
* And believing women who care for widowed relatives

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In the first part of this passage, Paul talks about the widows who the church should take care of. Paul talks about how the church should put these widows on some sort of official list of widows. We do not know if church leaders wrote the names on a document, or if the leaders just knew the names of the widows they needed to take care of.

Stop here and discuss as a group: In your culture, when you need to know an official list of people, how do you keep that information? Do you write that information down, or keep the information in another way? How will you talk about these widows being on some sort of official list that the church leaders knew about? Pause this audio here.

Paul lists three qualities that these widows should have. Paul talks about these widows as if the widows are one person, but he is talking about the qualities that all of these widows should have. She, the widow, must be over 60, she must have been faithful to her husband, and people must know the widow for her good works. And then, Paul gives examples of these good works. Paul specifically mentions that the widow should have raised her children well, she would have shown hospitality, she should have washed believers' feet, and she should have cared for those who were in trouble.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: The requirement that this widow should be faithful to her husband is the same requirement that Paul gives to the overseers and deacons earlier in 1 Timothy. Think back to how you translated that requirement there and discuss how you might translate it here. What are some examples of caring for someone who is in trouble? Discuss how you might translate the idea of caring for those who are in trouble. Pause this audio here.

In the second part of this passage, Paul talks about the widows who the church should not add to the list. Paul describes a widow who turns away from Christ because of her sexual desires. God judges this widow because she has left her first faith.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How can you make it clear that the problem is not that the widow wants to marry someone but that her desires lead her away from Christ? Discuss how you might describe how the widows break their first pledge or leave their first faith. Pause this audio here.

Paul also describes the danger that these young widows could face if the church adds them to the list of widows. These young widows could learn to be lazy, become gossipers, and involve themselves in other people's business. So, Paul encourages the younger widows to get married, have children, and take care of their homes. Finally, Paul warns that some young widows have already left the faith and turned to follow Satan.

In the final part of this passage, Paul tells women in the church that the women should care for their relatives who are widows. The church should not have to care for these widows. Widows with family to care for them should not be a burden to the church. Paul compares these widows to a heavy load that someone would have to carry. If families take care of their own widows, the church will be able to care for other widows who do not have any help.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What do you think Paul means when Paul says he does not want these widows to be a burden to the church? What word or phrase do you think you could use here? Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

It is helpful to remember that Paul talks about a different kind of widow in each part. Paul talks about widows who should be added to the list, younger widows, and widows who have family to help care for them. In the second part of this passage, it might be helpful to have three young widows. One of the widows is led away by her desires. One of the widows lives the godly life of a wife and a mother. And the third widow becomes lazy, gossips, and gets involved in other people's business.

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 5:9–16 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Members of the church
* People in the community who are not believers
* Widows who the church should add to the list
* Younger widows who leave the faith
* Younger widows who live a godly life
* New husbands and household members
* Jesus Christ
* Satan
* Widows who have family to help them
* And believing women who care for widowed relatives

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "Put a widow on the official list if she is 60 years old, has been a faithful wife, and has a reputation for good works."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the widow, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel grateful that the church would take care of me; or
* I feel relieved to know that I have people ready to help me if I need help.

Paul says, "Refuse to enroll, or include, younger widows."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the younger widow, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel confused that Paul will not let us be on the list; or
* I feel motivated to find another way to care for myself.

Paul explains that these young widows might leave their first faith.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the young widow who has left the faith, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I wanted to marry someone else, so I left the church and married who I wanted; or
* I feel like I should be able to do what I want; or
* I was desperate! I needed someone to take care of me!

Paul says, "Some have already strayed after Satan."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel discouraged that young widows have been led away from the faith; or
* I feel protective of these young widows and want to help them keep their faith.

Paul says, "Women should care for the widows in their own family. Do not let the church have to care for them. The church should be free to care for widows who do not have any help."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the women who Paul tells to care for the widows in their family, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel the charge to care for my family; or
* I feel like I want to care for my family so that the church can be free to help other widows; or
* I do not want to be a burden to the church.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 5:9–16 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Twice in this section Paul talks about **good works**. Paul says that widows who the church adds to the list should be known for their good works. Good works are the things a believer does when they hear God's good instructions. When people know a widow for her good works, that means people know the woman as someone who has lived her life following God's ways. Use the same word or phrase for good works as you used in previous passages.

One of the good works that the widows do is to wash the feet of the **saints**, or God's holy people who God has set apart as his own. All believers are saints.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **saints**. Look up saints in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have translated saints in another book of the Bible, use the same word as you used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul warns that the desires of these younger widows might overcome the widows' dedication to **Christ**. Here, Paul uses Christ as a title to refer to Jesus. Use the same word or phrase for Christ as you used in previous passages. Look up Christ in the Master Glossary for more information.

Paul says that the widows who leave their first faith bring **judgment** on themselves. Paul means that God will judge these widows who have left the faith. These widows will face the consequences for their wrong actions. Though Paul does not specify what this judgment is, it is strong language that carries a serious tone to it. Use the same word or phrase for judgment as you used in previous passages.

Paul says that God will judge younger widows if they leave their first **faith**. When Paul talks about this first faith, Paul means the Christian faith. To leave their first faith means that these widows stop following God and trusting in Jesus. Use the same word or phrase for faith as you used in previous passages. Look up faith in the Master Glossary for more information.

Paul says that some widows have already left the faith and followed after **Satan**. Throughout the Bible, we see that Satan is a chief enemy of God. Satan is a deceiver and tries to lead people away from God. To follow after Satan is to stop following God. Use the same word or phrase for Satan as you used in previous passages. Look up Satan in the Master Glossary for more information.

Paul tells **believing** women to care for their own relatives who are widows so that they do not burden the **church**. A believing woman is someone who has believed in Jesus and follows God. Use the same words or phrases for believer and church as you have used in previous passages, and look up believer and church in the Master Glossary for more information.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 5:17–25 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this passage, Paul continues to teach Timothy about how individuals and leaders should behave as members of God's church. Paul focuses on how Timothy and the rest of the people in the church should treat the leaders of the church, called the church elders.

The elders of the church community are probably the same group of people as the overseers whom Paul spoke of earlier in 1 Timothy. In the New Testament, elders are not simply older Christians in the community. Elders are people who others respect. An elder's official, recognized role is to guide the matters of the church. The elders who do their work well do a good thing and deserve double honor from the church community. That is, the church should respect its leaders very much, and the church should also help the elders with material needs. In other words, church members should also make sure the elders have enough money, food, clothing, or whatever else the elders need to live. This is especially true for the elders who preach about Jesus and teach people to obey Jesus.

Paul then mentions a saying from Old Testament Scripture to show Paul's point. Paul gives the example of an ox that treads out grain. People must not put a muzzle on the ox that would keep the ox from eating the grain while the ox works. An ox is a large, strong animal like a cow or bull, and farmers would often use one or more oxen to help with the farm work. For example, oxen could pull plows or heavy carts. When farmers harvested wheat, the farmers needed to separate the kernels from the cut stalks. To do this, the farmers made an ox walk over the stalks many times. If a farmer wanted to keep an ox from eating the grain, the farmer would put something called a muzzle over the mouth of the ox.

Stop here and, as a group, look at a picture of oxen threshing wheat. Also look at a picture of a muzzle. Pause the audio here.

Paul spoke of this muzzled ox to show how the church community should care for the elders. Someone who uses an ox to thresh grain should allow the ox to eat what it needs, and similarly, the church should give their elders what the elders need. Paul then mentions a saying from New Testament Scripture to emphasize Paul's point that the church should help the elders with what the elders need. Paul says that the person who works deserves to receive payment for his work.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do people care for the leaders of your community? What kinds of things might people give their leaders to help sustain them? Pause the audio here.

Paul instructs Timothy about what to do when someone accuses an elder of doing wrong things, or sinning. The Old Testament law said that a judge had to listen to at least two witnesses when someone accused a person of wrongdoing. Jesus said the same thing in the book of Matthew. Timothy is not to accept someone's accusation against an elder unless at least two or three people have seen or heard the elder sin. When Timothy finds that an elder is sinning, Timothy is to rebuke, confront, and correct the person who sins. Timothy should do this publicly, in the presence of the congregation, so that the others, that is, the other elders, will fear to do what is wrong and will choose to do what is right.

Then Paul commands Timothy to do something very important. Paul emphasizes what he is about to say by implying that God, Christ Jesus, and even God's specially chosen angels will witness whether Timothy obeys Paul or not. Paul commands Timothy to obey Paul's instructions without judging people before Timothy hears all the witnesses. Timothy also should not show favoritism toward or against any person. Timothy must treat every elder in the same, fair way.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what happens when someone accuses another person of sin? How might people respond to the accusation? What might people do to make sure they judge the situation well? Pause the audio here.

Paul tells Timothy to be patient and careful when choosing people to be new leaders for the community of believers. In other words, Paul wanted Timothy not to rush but to take enough time to ensure that the person was qualified to be a good elder. When Timothy and the other leaders of the believers appointed a person to be an elder, the leaders did something that was commonly called "laying on of hands." Timothy and the other leaders of the believers stood around the person they were appointing, placed their hands on him, and prayed for him.

Paul also did not want Timothy to share in the sins of others. This means Paul did not want Timothy to partner with other elders who practiced sinful things. If Timothy appointed an elder too quickly before he knew the man's character, Timothy would share in the sins of that elder. That is, Timothy would be partly responsible for the sins that the elder committed. Paul wants Timothy to keep himself pure, free from sin, and avoid sinning in any major way.

Stop here and discuss as a group: Tell about a time in your community when a leader did something that was not good. How did the community feel about the person who had appointed or commissioned that leader? Pause this audio here.

One such way that Timothy may have tried to keep himself pure was by never drinking wine, which is an alcoholic drink made of fermented grape juice. During the time when Timothy lived, people often drank wine. However, if a person drank too much wine, he would become drunk, which was not good, especially for a church leader. Here Paul told Timothy that Timothy could drink some wine for health reasons. The amount of wine was not enough to make Timothy drunk. And the purpose of drinking the wine was to help Timothy's stomach or digestion because Timothy was sick so often.

Stop here and discuss as a group: How do people feel about drinking wine or alcohol in your community? For what purposes would you drink alcohol? Pause this audio here.

Finally, Paul continues his instruction about elders by saying that the sins of some people are obvious. Paul means that some men who Timothy chose as elders might sin in ways that most other people could easily see or discover. So then Timothy and other church leaders could judge that the person with obvious sins is not an acceptable leader of the church. But some other people sin secretly, and their sin may not be obvious until later.

In the same way that it may or may not take time to learn about sins, it can also take some time to learn about the good deeds that a person does. When a person does good things, what the person does is obvious. But even when good deeds are not obvious, other people will eventually recognize those deeds.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 5:17–25 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has two main parts.

**In the first part:** Paul instructs Timothy on how Timothy and the members of the church should honor the elders of the church.

**In the second part:** Paul gives instructions concerning sin and purity among church leaders. Here Paul focuses on what to do when someone accuses an elder of sin, Timothy's own purity, and patience when appointing new church leaders.

The characters in this passage are:

* The church elders
* The members of the church
* An ox
* The laborer
* Two or three witnesses
* Elders who continue to sin
* God
* Christ Jesus
* Angels that God specially chose
* Paul
* And Timothy

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Paul begins this passage with a command for Timothy and the members of the church. Paul tells them to honor elders who do their work well. Paul says his reason for giving this command comes from Scripture. One Scripture saying Paul talks about mentions an ox that treads grain, and the other mentions a worker who deserves to be paid for the work he has done.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What do you say when you want to show that a saying came from Scripture? What word or phrase might you use to quote a saying from a commonly known story or proverb? Pause the audio here.

In the next part of this passage, Paul is mainly concerned with sin and purity. First, Paul commands Timothy not to listen when someone accuses an elder unless at least two or three people have seen or heard the elder sin. If an elder is sinning, the other leaders should confront and correct the elder who sins. Most likely, when Paul says that the leaders should confront the elder in front of everyone, Paul means that they should confront the elder in front of the entire church. Then the other elders and the church members can see that it is important to follow God's laws.

Next, Paul emphasizes that it is very important for Timothy to be pure himself when he judges the purity of other elders. By naming God, Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, Paul shows that he is very serious. Paul also does this to remind Timothy of the truth that God, Jesus, and the angels know what Timothy does in these matters, so Timothy should act in a most pure way.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: When a person is very serious and wants to command someone else to do something very important, what kinds of things might the person say? Pause the audio here.

Paul then urges Timothy to be patient and pure when Timothy lays hands on, or appoints, elders. Paul states the first part of this instruction in a negative way: Paul says, "Do not be hasty, or quick, when you appoint elders and therefore share in their sins." Paul means that Timothy should take the time Timothy needs to understand the elders' character. As Paul will say later in this part of his letter, sometimes we do not know a person's good or bad actions immediately. It takes time to see a person's actions. If Timothy is not patient, and Timothy appoints people who sin, Timothy will take part in their sins also! Instead, Timothy should be pure, or completely devoted to God and to following God's laws. Paul's instructions to Timothy about this would also apply to the elders of the church who will lead after Timothy leaves.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How will you show that Paul tells Timothy to be patient and take time to understand a person's character before Timothy appoints that person as an elder? Pause this audio here.

Many translations understand Paul's next statement about drinking a little wine as a side comment that Paul made personally to Timothy. This statement seems to be out of place here in the teaching about elders. However, perhaps Timothy, as an elder, thought that he should not drink any wine at all in order to keep himself pure. Timothy must have often been sick with stomach issues. Paul suggests that if Timothy would drink a little wine, it would help Timothy's stomach to be well.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In the middle of Paul's instructions to Timothy about the elders in a church, Paul gives Timothy personal instructions about Timothy's health that are related to the purity of elders. How would you translate this extra information? Pause the audio here.

As Paul ends this passage, Paul speaks of how sometimes we can see a person's sins and good works right away, but sometimes we do not see those things until later in someone's life. First Paul talks about how people can see some sins right away, but people may not see other sins until later. Similarly, people can see some good works right away, and eventually people will be able to see every good work.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you would translate this idea most naturally in your language. Pause the audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to represent each character in this passage. Show that elders do an important job, and that the church members give the elders what they need to live. When someone accuses an elder of wrongdoing, you could show that Timothy at first rejects the accusation. Then people bring two or three witnesses, and Timothy listens to the accusation and discusses the problem in front of the entire church. Show that God, Christ Jesus, and certain angels watch everything that Timothy does. Show how God instructs Timothy, and how Timothy listens to God and completely devotes himself to God. Timothy listens to God before he appoints new church leaders. God also cares about people's health, and so Paul tells Timothy to drink a little wine to help his health. Timothy agrees, and he drinks the wine, but Timothy looks at God and is completely devoted to God all the time. Then Timothy looks around at the other elders and the church members. Some people do good things, and bad things, at the back of the group where no one can see them. Then show how the group of people move to the side so that everyone can see what is happening at the back of the group. In this way, everyone will eventually see the good and bad actions of everyone.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has two parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* The church elders
* The members of the church
* An ox
* The laborer
* An accuser
* Two or three witnesses
* Elders who continue to sin
* God
* Christ Jesus
* Angels that God specially chose
* Paul
* And Timothy

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul instructs Timothy how Timothy and the church congregation should honor the elders of the church, especially the preachers and teachers. Paul uses two sayings to show his point. First, Paul speaks of an ox that treads grain, and then he says that those who work deserve their pay.

Pause the drama.

Ask a person who plays a member of the congregation, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am realizing it is important for me to give some of my money and resources to the church so that we honor the leaders well and take care of them; or
* It is sometimes not easy to give money, but because I love the church, I will honor my elders in this way. The leaders take care of the church, and the church must take care of the leaders too.

Paul continues to give instructions to Timothy about elders. Paul focuses on sin and purity among church leaders. When someone accuses an elder of sin, Timothy must not listen to it unless at least two or three witnesses confirm the sin. The church leaders are to confront and directly correct the sinners in front of the whole church as a strong warning to others. Paul very strongly commands Timothy to fairly follow these instructions in the presence of God, Christ Jesus, and God's chosen, highest angels.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am sad to hear that there will be sin among the leaders of the church, but I am glad to know that God knows this and gives us a good way to deal with it; or
* This is a very stern warning from Paul. I must follow this absolutely fairly, without showing favoritism; or
* It is hard not to show favoritism to the elders who are my good friends.

Paul continues to teach about appointing elders. Paul says that Timothy should be patient, or fully understand a person's character, before he appoints that person as an elder in the church.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am concerned with purity in the church leadership; or
* I am confident that in the end, God knows every single thing that people do, whether good or bad.

Paul continues to teach that it is good to not appoint elders too quickly. A person's sins, and also his good deeds, are sometimes visible right away, but sometimes it takes time to truly see those deeds.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel nervous about choosing elders because it is difficult and takes a long time to truly know a person and their sins and good works; or
* Paul's instructions about elders are serious. I am worried I might choose an elder poorly.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 5:17–25 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

The **elders** of the church community are probably the same group of people as the overseers who Paul spoke of earlier in 1 Timothy, even though Paul uses a different word here. You may use the same word, or two different words, to refer to this group of people.

Stop here as a group and look up elder in the Master Glossary. Translate elder in the same way you have in other passages. Pause this audio here.

Although many translations do not use the word for **church** in this passage, you may choose to say "elders of the church" if it makes your translation more natural. If you use the word church, use the same word for church as you have used in previous passages, and look up church in the Master Glossary for more information.

Paul says that people should honor these elders who preach and teach well. Use the same words for preaching and teaching as you have used in previous passages.

In this passage, Paul mentions two different sayings from **Scripture** to strengthen his point. Scripture, or sometimes the holy scriptures, are the specific collected writings of the Old and New Testaments that tell us about God, who is holy. When people in the New Testament talk about the Scripture, or the Scriptures, they are most often talking about the part of the Bible that Christians now call the Old Testament. Here in this passage, Paul first talks about a saying from the Old Testament about an ox that treads grain. Then Paul talks about a New Testament saying from Jesus, that a laborer deserves his wages. Look up Scripture in the Master Glossary for more information and use the same word for Scripture that you have used in previous passages.

Paul speaks of an ox that treads out grain to show how church members should care for the elders of the church. An **ox** is a large, strong animal like a cow or bull, and farmers would often use one or more oxen to help with the farm work. For example, an ox or multiple oxen could pull plows or heavy carts. When farmers harvested wheat, the farmers needed to separate the kernels from the cut stalks. The farmers did this by making an ox walk over the stalks many times. This is called an ox **treading out grain**. If a farmer wanted to keep an ox from eating the grain, the farmer would put something called a **muzzle** over the mouth of the ox.

Stop here as a group and look at a picture of oxen threshing wheat. Also look at a picture of a muzzle. How will you talk about an ox treading out grain? Pause the audio here.

Paul told Timothy that God and Christ Jesus and God's special chosen angels see what Timothy does. **Christ** is a title for Jesus. The original text says Christ Jesus here. But if the order Christ Jesus confuses people who will hear this, then Jesus Christ is acceptable. Use the same phrase that you used there. Look up Christ in the Master Glossary for more information.

An **angel** is a supernatural, spiritual being who is a messenger from God. The elect or chosen angels are the angels that God has chosen and who worship and follow God. Look up angel in the Master Glossary for more information, and use the same word for angel that you have used in previous passages.

Paul urges Timothy to avoid **sins** and to keep himself **pure**. Sin is an act of rebellion against God. Any time a person disobeys God's laws, that person sins. The opposite of a sinful person is a pure person. Pure means not mixed. A pure heart is a heart that is only good, with nothing bad mixed with it. In the Bible, someone with a pure heart often describes someone whom God saves and makes good through Jesus. Look up sin or pure in the Master Glossary for more information, and use the same words that you have used in previous passages.

Paul tells Timothy to not be quick to **lay hands** on someone. Use the same words or phrase for laying hands on someone as you have used in previous passages.

**Wine** is a drink made from grapes. Wine is fermented and alcoholic. During the time when Paul wrote this letter, people normally drank wine with their meals. Paul spoke about wine in a previous passage in 1 Timothy, when Paul taught about deacons. Use the same word or phrase as you did in that passage. Look up wine in the Master Glossary for more information.

When Paul speaks of **judgment** in this passage, Paul means that Timothy and the elders have a responsibility and ability to judge whether a candidate elder has acceptable, righteous character. Use the same word for judgment that you used in previous passages.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 6:1–2 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

Paul has been teaching Timothy about how different groups in God's church should act and treat each other. Now Paul will tell Timothy what Timothy should teach believers who are slaves. Paul wants the slaves to treat their masters with respect, especially if their master is a believer.

Masters are people who owned slaves. Slaves are people who had to work without pay for their masters. Many slaves became believers and there were probably a large group of slaves in the church in Ephesus. Some slaves who had become believers may have started to disrespect or disobey their masters. Perhaps the slaves felt that they should only obey God and that they no longer had to obey their masters.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when people owned slaves, either in your people's history or in a land near yours. How did the slaves act? How did the slaves' masters expect the slaves to act? Pause this audio here.

However, Paul tells the believers who are slaves that they should treat their masters with all respect and honor, even if their masters really do not deserve respect.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, how do you show respect to people you work for? Why do you show respect to them? Pause this audio here.

Paul knows that it is not easy to be a slave. Paul compares slavery to a yoke, which is a wooden frame that people put over the necks of animals, such as oxen. Then the animals can pull things like carts together. The animals cannot free themselves from the yoke, just like slaves cannot free themselves from their masters. Paul does not say that slavery is good, but Paul is saying that there is something more important than being free. It is more important to show other people how good God is, and how good God's gospel, or good news about Jesus, is.

Stop here and look at a picture of a yoke as a group. Pause this audio here.

The believers who are slaves are God's people. Often, other people honor or dishonor God based on the behavior of his people. If the slaves act disrespectfully to their masters, they will bring dishonor not just to themselves, but to God himself. The slaves will also bring dishonor to the gospel that Paul teaches and the slaves have believed. People may be confused and think that the gospel teaches people to be disrespectful. The people may say false and insulting things about God and his gospel. This could also be dangerous for the believers. If the rulers in the area thought that a religion or group might cause slaves to behave badly, the rulers would persecute or attack that group.

On the other hand, the believers who are slaves have the opportunity to show how good God and his gospel is by the way they behave! The slaves can show how Jesus has taught them to show love to each other as they serve and respect their masters.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when you were the only believer in a group of people. How did you show that you were a believer? What did you want people to think about you and the good news? How did you try to show that to people? How did people treat you when they knew you were a believer? Pause this audio here.

Paul also describes what slaves should do if their master is a believer. Because both the slave and master are believers, they are equal before Christ. So some slaves may have thought they could treat their masters with less respect because they were equal. However, Paul says that the believer who is a slave should treat their master who is a believer with even more respect. The slave would show kindness and love toward his believer master when he worked for him and helped him. This is a reminder to both the slaves and the master that the slaves serve out of love for a fellow believer, not because the master is better or more important than the slave.

In this time, rich people in high, important positions were often benefactors who helped people in lower positions. Then other people would see that the rich people were powerful and would honor the rich people. But Paul says it is not just the rich, important people who can be benefactors. Though most people thought slaves were unimportant, Paul says the slaves can also be benefactors, which is a role that people honor and respect. Jesus taught that the greatest people serve others because they love others, just like Jesus does. The slaves do not serve just because they have to, but they do good for their masters out of love, to help their masters.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what family members do you show great respect to, even though you are members of the same family? Why do you do this? How do you show your respect to those people?

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 6:1–2 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has two parts.

**In the first part:** Paul says that believers who are slaves should treat their masters with respect, so that no one will say bad things about God or his gospel.

**In the second part:** If a slave's master is a believer, those slaves should respect their masters even more, because the slaves love their fellow believers.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* The believers who are slaves
* The masters who are not believers
* Other people who slander God's reputation
* The masters who are believers
* And God

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Paul has already written to the Ephesians about how masters and slaves should treat each other, so Paul only gives a short reminder to the slaves about respect. Paul is focused on the slave's behavior as well as their attitude. Everything the believers do should honor God, even if the believer is a slave.

In the first part, Paul gives Timothy instructions for all the believers who are slaves. Paul compares slavery to a yoke, which controls animals. This yoke is heavy and hard, just like people who are slaves have a hard life that they cannot free themselves from.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how would you describe a role or a situation that is hard to live with and that you cannot easily get away from? Pause this audio here.

Paul says that slaves should still consider their masters worthy of respect. Paul is talking about both how slaves think about their masters as well as how the slaves should act. The slaves should show their respect as they obey their master and honor their master with their words. The slave's behavior will affect what other people think about God and his gospel. If the slaves act disrespectfully, they can bring dishonor to God's name. God's name is God's reputation or his character. If other people see believers act disrespectfully, then those people may think that God approves of disrespectful behavior. The people may even think that God has asked the believers to teach this kind of behavior! People would slander God and what God has asked the believers to teach, which means they would insult and say false and hurtful things about God and his gospel.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Paul says "God's name" to talk about God's reputation. In your language, what words or phrases would you use to talk about your reputation or what people think about you? Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How would you say that someone insults someone else in order to hurt that person's reputation? Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul gives Timothy instructions that Timothy is to tell the slaves who are believers and whose masters are also believers. These slaves should not show less respect to their masters because they are both believers. Instead, those slaves should work even harder for their masters. These slaves' masters are family members, since God is the father of both the slaves and the masters. The masters are dear to the slaves, and the slaves should show their love as they respect and serve their masters. Some translations say that the slaves should serve their masters because the masters work to help their slaves who are fellow believers. While believers who are masters may do this, Paul is probably focusing on how the slaves work to help their masters because they love their masters who are fellow believers.

Paul says that these are the things that Timothy should teach. While Timothy does need to teach the slaves what Paul just said, this statement really goes with the next passage, as Paul begins to talk about something new, so we will discuss it in the next passage.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. As you do this, you might want to have drawings, objects, or even people to represent Paul, Timothy, the believers who are slaves, the masters who are not believers, the masters who are believers, God, and other people.

Choose people, drawings, or objects to each be one of these. As you begin to retell the story of these verses, remember that Paul is speaking to Timothy. After Paul finishes telling these instructions to Timothy, Timothy can then go tell them to the slaves. Remember, the masters who are believers will probably hear these instructions too as Timothy teaches the believers what Paul tells Timothy. Show how the slaves should respect their masters and do what their masters tell them to. Other people who are not believers can watch the slaves. When the slaves show respect, those other people can clap or say good things about God. When the masters who are believers ask the slaves to do something, those slaves can obey even faster. Show how the slaves care for their masters who are believers, and then show how God loves both slaves and masters.

* The believers who are slaves
* The masters who are not believers
* Other people who slander God's reputation
* The masters who are believers
* And God

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul said, "All believers who are slaves should honor their masters in every way, so that other people will not insult God and our teaching about the gospel."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I know this will be hard for the slaves, especially if their masters are not kind and good to them. I will pray that God will help the slaves and give the slaves patience; or
* God has taught me that his gospel is more important than doing what is easy or comfortable. A lot of my life is hard and scary, but I still have hope and joy that God has given me. I hope the slaves feel this too.

Ask the person who plays God, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I care for believers who are slaves and will help them when it feels too hard to show respect to their masters; or
* The slaves may feel like their work is useless because they have to work hard for other people without pay. However, I can use the way they work to show others the truth about me and my gospel; or
* When I save people who believe in me, I give them something they do not deserve. The slaves can follow my example when they show respect to masters who do not deserve it. Then other people can see what the believers have learned from me.

Then Paul said, "Those slaves who have masters who are also believers must not show less honor to their masters because they are fellow believers in Christ. Instead, those slaves should work even harder for their masters, because those masters for whom they work are also believers. The believing masters love the slaves, and the believing slaves love the masters."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the slaves, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* It is easier to work for a fellow believer when I do it to show love instead of because I have to; or
* I feel frustrated or angry sometimes that I have to work harder than other believers, but I trust that God is fair and will show kindness to me still; or
* This feels like a hard command to follow. I will need help to do what God asks me to! I am glad that the Holy Spirit helps me to follow what God has told me to do.

Ask the person who plays the masters who are believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* When Paul tells the slaves that they should show love to me because I am their brother, then I should show love to my slaves too, because they are my brothers. I should treat them kindly and not make it hard to work for me; or
* I feel embarrassed when my slaves do not listen to me and disrespect me. Other people think that my slaves disrespect me because of what they believe. They also think I am silly for believing the same thing that causes my slaves to disrespect me; or
* If a slave is my brother, maybe I should treat him fairly and pay him for the work he does for me.

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 6:1–2 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul gives Timothy instructions to tell to believers who are **slaves**. Slaves worked for other people and usually had no rights to leave their work. For more information on slaves, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for slave as you used in previous passages.

Slaves should treat their **masters** with respect. A master is a respectful title for someone in a high position or status. Paul is talking about masters who own other people as slaves.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **master**. Look up master in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

If the slaves do not treat their masters with respect, then other people will slander or **blaspheme** God or the believers' teaching, or **doctrine**. To blaspheme someone means to speak evil about a person, and to insult someone. A person who curses God, insults God, dishonors God, or makes God seem less powerful or important is blaspheming God. For more information on blasphemy and doctrine, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same words or phrases for blaspheme and doctrine as you used in previous passages.

Paul says that masters who are believers are the slaves' **brothers**. Since God is the Father of all believers, all believers are like brothers and sisters. So Paul frequently uses the word for brother for fellow believers. For more information on brothers, refer to believers in the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for brothers or brothers and sisters as you used in previous passages.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 6:2–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

Paul has been talking about how different groups in the church should act. Now, in this part of his letter, Paul warns Timothy again about false teachers, or people who teach things that are not true. These false teachers act in many bad ways, but especially when they try to get money when they teach about God. Paul says it is dangerous to want a lot of money and that believers should instead be content with what they have.

This part of the letter begins with the previous statement, when Paul reminds Timothy to teach the truth, so that people will know the difference between what is true and what false or bad teachers say. Paul and Timothy teach what Christ taught when he was alive on earth and what Christ has taught through people like Paul. However, there are people, false teachers, who teach things about Christ and his message that are different from what Christ, Paul, and Timothy teach. These false teachers are proud and think they know better than Christ. However, these teachers really do not understand what they teach. As a result, these false teachers and their followers like to argue and disagree with other people. Then they envy or strongly want what others have and split into groups. They say harsh and evil things about each other and start to believe evil things about each other, even if there is no proof of those evil things! These people constantly argue and the way they think is now totally bad or evil. These people no longer understand the truth.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, how do good religious leaders act? Now think of some bad religious leaders, ones that you do not respect. How do they act? Why do you not respect those people? Pause this audio here.

One of the lies these people believe is that godliness, or living in a way that pleases God, is a way to get money! In Paul's time, people often gained money by going from town to town to teach different religions. These teachers would charge other people money to listen to their teaching about God. That is what the false teachers in Ephesus are also trying to do.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, when religious leaders travel, how do the leaders pay for their food, travel, or housing costs? What are religious teachers supposed to do with money? Pause this audio here.

People do gain something from godliness, or behaving how God wants, but Paul says it is not money! When people behave in a godly way and are satisfied with what God has given them, then they live well with God both now and forever. These people will not be worried or anxious about getting more money here on earth. Instead, these people trust that God will provide for them and they look forward to when they will live with God.

Paul explains that people do not get to keep or own anything forever. When a person is born, that person brings nothing into the world. That person does not have any money or possessions or even any clothes! When people die, they will be the same way. Everything those people own will still be in this world for other people to use. No one can keep any money or possessions when they die. So it is useless to gather more money and possessions than you need while you are alive. Instead, people should be satisfied with just the things that they need, like food and clothing.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, when a person dies, what happens to the things that person owned? What do people believe that dead people need from this world in their life after death? Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What are some things that people say about how you should live so that you can be happy or content with the way you live? Some advice is good and helpful, and some is not! What kind of people give better advice? Why do you think this is? Pause this audio here.

Paul explains that if a person strongly wants to be rich more than anything else, then that person is in danger. These people feel temptation, or desire to do things that are unwise and sinful and can hurt themselves or other people. If people do these things, they will destroy their lives. This does not mean that they kill themselves, but that they destroy important and good relationships, ways of thinking, habits, and anything else that brings happiness in their lives.

Paul explains that the way people love money is often the reason people do all kinds of evil things. When people love or care about money more than anything else, then those people do evil things and receive all kinds of trouble. For example, when people want to become rich, they may easily become selfish. Those people may cheat, lie, steal, envy, or quarrel. Those people may hate people, hurt them, and even kill them.

Some people who want money have stopped believing what is true and have hurt themselves, just as if they have stabbed themselves. Those people often suffer terribly. Those people feel guilty and anxious. Those people feel sorrow and grief. This is very different from the hope and joy believers feel when they live in a godly way to please God. Then those believers have a good relationship with God and with other believers!

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about someone who wanted to get rich, but when they got a lot of money, they were not happy. Why do you think those people were not happy?

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 6:2–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul warns Timothy about false teachers, who teach things about Christ and his message that are not true. These teachers discuss unimportant issues that cause arguments. These teachers do not understand how to know what is true and what is false. These teachers think that teaching about God is just a way to become rich.

**In the second part:** Paul explains that a person is only happy when he obeys God, not when he has a lot of money.

**In the third part:** People who want to be rich will want to do dangerous and evil things that will destroy them. These people hurt themselves because they stop believing what is true.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* The believers
* False teachers, who want to be rich
* People who listen to the false teachers and strongly desire to be rich
* And the Lord Jesus Christ

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Remember, at the beginning of this letter, Paul warned Timothy about false teachers who do not understand the law of God. Now, in this part of the letter, Paul explains that false teachers do not understand what godliness is or what true riches are. This part of the letter sets up the contrast with the next part, where Paul will explain how a believer can have true riches, or a good relationship with God.

The first part of this passage begins with the last sentence in verse two, as Paul finishes talking about slaves and begins to talk about godliness. Paul reminds Timothy that Timothy should not only teach what is in this letter, but also urge the believers to follow these teachings. What Paul and Timothy teach is from the Lord Jesus Christ. This teaching is sound or healthy, which means that it is correct and helpful, just like healthy food is good and helpful for a person. It is godly teaching, which means it is the kind of teaching that helps people to behave as God wants them to behave.

These other teachers do not agree with Christ. Paul says these teachers are conceited or proud, because they think they know better than Christ, but really, they understand nothing. Paul did not literally mean that the false teachers understood nothing at all. Paul meant that the false teachers did not really understand what they were teaching about when they teach about God. Paul says these teachers have unhealthy interests, which hurt them like a sickness hurts them. These teachers love controversy, or to constantly talk about different opinions without trying to find the right one. These teachers argue and quarrel with other people about the meaning of words. This causes the teachers to behave in ways that hurt themselves and their followers.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Paul describes Jesus's teaching as healthy, because it is correct and helpful to people. Paul also describes the false teachers' desires as unhealthy, because those desires are bad and hurt people. In your language, how would you talk about teachings or ways of acting that are good and helpful to a person? How would you describe teachings that are bad and hurt people? Pause this audio here.

Paul describes the ways the false teachers act, which their followers do too. These people envy each other, or strongly desire to have what others have. This causes these people to have strife or dissension, which means they fight and break up into groups. These people insult and say mean things about each other. These people start to have evil suspicions, which means they form an opinion on just a little bit of information, because they want to believe evil things about each other. So these people have constant friction or arguing since they do not trust or care for each other. Paul uses words that remind Timothy of two rough things that rub against each other and irritate each other. In the same way, people will begin to argue and irritate each other.

Stop here and discuss as a group: Think about your descriptions of bad religious leaders in step two. What kinds of words and phrases did you use to describe those people? How can you describe what Paul talks about in this passage? What words and phrases do you have that show how badly these false teachers act? Pause this audio here.

Paul says these people have a corrupt mind. Since the mind is where people think and understand things, this means that these people have wicked and wrong ways of thinking. It is like someone stole the ability to believe truth from these people. These people do not understand godliness, which is the way people behave when they respect God. The false teachers think that they can become rich when they behave in a godly way and charge money for people to listen to them teach about God.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how do you talk about the part of a person where that person thinks and understands things? How would you describe when a person has wicked and wrong ways that they think? Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul explains that money is not what people gain when they act in a godly way. If people act in a godly way and are content, or happy with what God gives them, then those people will live well with God both now and forever. People only have what God has given them and they can only keep it while they are alive. When a person is born, that person does not have anything. When that person dies, they do not get to own things any longer. So it is useless to gather more money and possessions than the person needs. Paul says we, the believers, will be or must be content with just what we need, such as food and clothing.

In the third part, Paul talks about people who are not content, but instead constantly want more money. Paul says that these people fall into dangerous things and ways of acting, like a person who walks too close to a cliff or a deep hole and falls and hurts themselves. These people feel temptation, or the desire to do bad things in order to get what they want. Their desire to be rich is like a trap that catches an animal. The person caught in such a trap cannot get free by himself. It is hard for people to stop wanting money, even though it causes them to want foolish and harmful things.

Stop here and look at a picture of a trap as a group. How would you describe a way of thinking that hurts someone but is hard to stop? Pause this audio here.

Paul says that people's desire for money will destroy people's lives or way of living, so that they are no longer happy, safe, or living in peace. It is like someone plunges or pushes them down into water so that they drown. Paul quotes a popular saying in that time, which many people would accept and know to be true. Paul says the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. Like a root is the hidden part of a plant that causes the plant to grow and exist, the way people love and eagerly want money is the hidden reason that they do evil things.

Stop here and look at a picture of a trap as a group. Tell a story about a time when someone acted in a strange or surprising way, then later you learned why they acted in that way. How would you talk about the thing or idea that was the reason that person acted in that way? Pause this audio here.

Because some people love money more than God, those people have wandered away from the faith. The faith is the true teaching about God and Christ. The people who love money are like a person who has wandered away from a safe path and into dangerous and rough ground. Those people do not believe the truth, but instead believe lies. People suffer when they believe these lies and feel many griefs or pains. It is like these people have stabbed themselves with a sword, because they have caused their own pain.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. As you do this, you might want to use drawings, objects, or even people to represent Paul, Timothy, the believers, false teachers, people who listen to the false teachers, the Lord Jesus Christ, and God.

Choose people, drawings, or objects to be each one of these. As you begin to retell the story of these verses, remember that Paul is speaking to Timothy. After Paul finishes telling these instructions to Timothy, Timothy can then go tell them to the Ephesian believers. While Timothy speaks to the Ephesian believers, have the false teachers teach different things to their followers. Show how the group of believers is different from the false teachers and their followers. The false teachers' group argues, splits into groups, and says mean things about each other. The false teachers keep asking their followers for money because they want to be rich! However, show how the false teachers are not happy with what they have. Act out how the believers are happy with the food and clothing they have as they do what God tells them to do. Pretend that you carry a newborn baby, and see how the baby does not have any money or possessions! Someone can act out what it is like when someone dies and that person cannot take their money with them. Act out how the people who want to be rich are in a trap that they cannot get out of. Look at a plant and, if you can, look at its root. See how the root leads to the plant, just like people's love of money leads to evil things. Show how those people walk away from the believers and what they believe. Those people can pretend to stab themselves to show how they have caused their own pain.

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 6:2–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three scenes.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* The believers
* False teachers
* People who listen to the false teachers and strongly desire to be rich
* And the Lord Jesus Christ

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul said, "Teach the believers these things that I am writing to you, Timothy, and encourage them to do them. Some people are teaching things that are not true and not consistent with the true things that our Lord Jesus Christ taught. They do not teach things that help people to behave as God wants. These people are proud. They do not really understand anything. They feel an unhealthy enjoyment in debating with each other and arguing about what words mean. Then they envy one another and they fight with each other. They insult each other and suspect each other of doing evil. There is constant conflict between these people who can no longer tell the difference between right and wrong. It is as if someone has stolen from them the ability to understand the truth. These false teachers think that if they teach about God they can become rich."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the false teachers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I like how powerful and comfortable I feel when I have a lot of money! I do not care if I have to fight or hurt other people to get it; or
* I am smart and know many things. I can figure out a way to get money from people if I convince them that I know more than they do and that they need to know what I know. Then I will tell them that they have to pay me to hear what I know! or
* If I act in a certain way, then God will be happy with me and give me lots of good things like money, which is what I really want!

Ask the person who plays Jesus, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I taught people how to act not so they can make God like them, but so they can show their love for God when they listen to and obey his ways; or
* I care about my people and I give them good things. However, the best thing I give them is not money, but a good relationship with me; or
* I want people to act in a godly way so that they also can live peacefully with other people. When people act in a godly way, they are kind and loving towards one another.

Then Paul said, "But it is better to do what pleases God and be satisfied with what he gives us. For when we were born, we did not bring anything with us, and when we die, we cannot take anything with us. Therefore, if we have the food and clothing we need, we should be content with what we have."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the believers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* When I see the people who follow false teachers and the way those teachers live, I am sad and sorry for them. These people are unhappy and hurt each other. I feel thankful that God has taught us how to be content; or
* Sometimes I do worry about money and how I will get the things my family needs. However, Paul reminds me that God gives us what we need, so I can trust God instead of focusing on getting more money; or
* When I focus on getting more money, I feel anxious and unhappy. I want to learn how to be content with just what I need. I will ask God and the other believers to help me learn.

Paul said, "Some people want to become rich so much that they follow whatever tempts them. They get trapped like an animal. These people want to do things that are unwise and dangerous. These desires will ruin and destroy those people. For the way people want money too much is the reason people do all kinds of evil things. Some people have stopped believing the teachings about Christ because they wanted money so much. These people have caused themselves to suffer in many ways, like a person who has stabbed himself."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays the people who want to be rich, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I do not feel like people love me and respect me right now, and I want to change that. If I have money, people will respect me and think that I am important. Those people will treat me better and love me; or
* I know I am doing bad things, but once I have a lot of money, I can fix or make up for whatever bad things I have done. I can do a lot of good things with a lot of money, which will be more important than the bad things I do; or
* I do not trust people anymore because everyone just wants to take my money. I do not talk to the people I used to be friends with and I feel alone. But if I make enough money, then people will like me again. I have to get more money!

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* It is easy to look at rich people and just see the nice things they have. It is easy to think that they must be happy because they do not have to worry about having enough money. But money is not what makes people happy. Only God can give real joy that lasts; or
* If people focus on getting money, then they will not spend time with God, talk to him, worship him, and learn about him. I do not want believers to forget about this important and wonderful relationship that they have with God who loves and cares for them! or
* While it is good to want to provide good things for our families, the believers must not think that money will make everything good in their lives. Then they will trust in what money can give them instead of God.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 6:2–10 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul says that people will teach things that do not agree with the teaching, or **doctrine**, of the Lord Jesus Christ. Doctrine is all the teachings or statements that someone teaches or accepts and believes. Use the same word for doctrine as you have used in previous passages, and for more information on doctrine, refer to the Master Glossary.

A **lord** is a master over other people. A lord has full authority over these people, so the Israelites used this word for God, because God has authority over the whole world. Paul often uses this word for Jesus, to show that Jesus is God. For more information on Lord, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Lord as you used in previous passages.

**Christ** refers to the special king and Savior that God had promised to send, who is Jesus. For more information on Christ, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Christ as you used in previous passages.

These teachers also teach things that do not agree with **godly** teaching. A person who is godly loves God and with all his heart wants to behave in a way that pleases God. Godliness means to act in a way that pleases God. Godly teaching is a kind of teaching that helps people to behave as God wants them to behave. For more information on godly, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for godly as you used in previous passages.

These teachers and their followers will have **evil** suspicions about each other. Evil is the opposite of good. When people stop obeying God, those people begin to do evil actions.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **evil**. Look up evil in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul says these peoples' **minds** are corrupt. The mind refers to someone's thinking, understanding, and intelligence.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **mind**. Look up mind in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

The way people want money will be like a **trap**, which is an object people make to catch animals.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **trap**. Look at a picture of a trap again as needed. Pause this audio here.

The people described here have left the **faith**. To have faith in someone means to believe what that person says about himself is true. When Paul talks about the faith, Paul means the true teaching about God and Christ, where people believe or have faith in Christ. For more information on faith, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for the faith as you used in previous passages.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 6:11–16 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In the previous passage, Paul described people who teach wrong things. Paul wrote that these teachers regularly do bad things. These teachers do bad things for bad reasons. Often these teachers were greedy for riches. Because of this, some no longer believed in Jesus.

At the beginning of this part of the letter, Paul uses several ways to mark a strong contrast between the bad teachers' bad way of living and the way Paul wanted Timothy to live. The bad teachers did not understand what true riches were. Paul now describes a way to live that will give Timothy true riches—life forever with God.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: If you wanted to give someone advice on how to live, what sort of advice would you give? Pause this audio here.

Paul calls Timothy "man of God." People called prophets "men of God" in the Old Testament. God specially set apart the prophets to bring his message to his people. In the same way, God specially set apart Timothy to be a leader in the church and to bring his message to his people. Paul refers to this several times in this letter, especially in the place where Paul wrote about the gift that Timothy received when people prophesied and when elders placed their hands on Timothy. This is another way to mark the contrast between Timothy and the people who taught wrong things.

In this part of his letter, Paul used language that would have reminded Timothy of a soldier who fights in a battle or an athlete who competes in games. Paul used these sorts of images often when he wrote, including earlier in this letter. When Paul used these words, it helped Timothy to understand that Timothy needed to do his best, or use all his energy and effort, to do what Paul told Timothy to do.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What sorts of activities can you think of where people work hard and do their best? Pause this audio here.

Paul gave Timothy a list of good things—ways Timothy should try to live. This list is similar to others we see in Scripture.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How would you describe the good ways that a person should live? Pause this audio here.

Paul wrote about a good confession that both Timothy and Christ Jesus made. This good confession was probably the statement that Jesus is King. Jesus made it clear that he was king at his trial before Pilate, the Roman governor in Jerusalem who oversaw Jesus' crucifixion. Here, Paul reminded Timothy of the time that Timothy made that statement publicly. For Timothy, this probably happened either at his baptism or when Timothy became a pastor.

Paul also wrote that Timothy should obey his commandment "without spot." This would have reminded Timothy of the spotless or perfect animals that the Israelites were supposed to sacrifice to God. Timothy's obedience should be like a perfect offering to God.

At the end of this passage, Paul wrote about the time that the Lord Jesus Christ will return to earth in a way that everyone will see. As Paul thought about that, Paul wrote something that was probably a song of praise, listing ways that God is very special, strong, and amazing.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How does someone in your culture act if he is amazed at something and feels like praising it? What kinds of songs or poems do people use to praise something?

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 6:11–16 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul tells Timothy that Timothy should live like he runs away from bad things and runs towards good things. Paul tells Timothy to work very hard at this.

**In the second part:** Paul tells Timothy to obey what Paul has told Timothy, and Paul reminds Timothy that God watches Timothy.

**In the third part:** Paul praises God by describing how wonderful and powerful God is.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* Many witnesses
* God
* Christ Jesus
* And Pontius Pilate

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In some ways, this part of Paul's letter is a final summary of the type of person Paul wants Timothy to be. Paul switches from writing about other people to giving commands directly to Timothy. Paul wants to encourage Timothy about the good results that will happen when Timothy lives this way. Paul gives a brief warning, and then Paul gives several different sorts of encouragement to do what is right. Paul reminds Timothy that Timothy should keep chasing the prize of eternal life—life from God and with God who is the highest king of all. Timothy should do this because God has chosen Timothy to serve God and because Timothy has committed himself to serve God.

In the first part of the passage, Paul contrasts Timothy with the kind of people Paul wrote about before. Paul gets Timothy's attention when he calls Timothy, "You, man of God...." Paul tells Timothy to run away from bad things like a person runs away from danger—as fast as he can. Then Paul contrasts Timothy running away from one thing with Timothy running towards something else. Paul does this to show that Timothy should try very hard to do good things.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How would you speak to someone in a way that would tell that person you are talking to them and they should pay attention? How would you talk if you gave general advice to a young person about the sorts of wrong things and people he should avoid? Then how would you talk differently to give that same young person direct commands for how he should live? Finally, how would you describe trying very hard to avoid bad things and trying very hard to do good things? Pause this audio here.

Paul continues by listing good ways for Timothy to act. Paul tells Timothy to be righteous, or to do the things that God says are right. Timothy should be godly, or he should try to act like God wants him to. Timothy should have faith, or he should always trust God. Timothy should love God and other people. Timothy should have endurance; in other words, Timothy should be patient with people and keep working even when hard things happen. Timothy should be gentle; Timothy should not get annoyed with people or when things do not happen at the time or in the way Timothy wants them to. Timothy should think about other people's needs.

Then Paul reminds Timothy that to do these things is hard. Paul uses words that remind Timothy of a soldier in a battle or an athlete at a competition. Those people have to try their hardest to win. Other people or things would make it difficult for them to win. Timothy should also try his hardest to grab the prize that is eternal life. Timothy will earn this prize or win this victory by living the way Paul has just described. This is not just any fight or struggle. This is a good fight that requires Timothy to trust God and never stop believing that Jesus is King. Timothy also needs to remember that God called Timothy to come into the fight, and God promised Timothy the prize of eternal life. Timothy also willingly declared that he would join the fight in front of many people by publicly saying that Jesus is King.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How would you give someone a command to do something from now on? How would you encourage that person to expect to win a prize in the future? How would you remind that person of past events and commitments they had made to encourage them to keep going? Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul makes his command even stronger when he asks God and Jesus to be like two witnesses for an official event or at a trial. At that time, and in some cases now, witnesses watched whenever someone would buy or sell property or at a wedding or other important event. If a person did not keep his commitments, the witnesses would tell the elders, "We saw this person make a commitment." Then the elders would give some consequence for not keeping the commitment. Paul clarifies that when Paul says God is a witness, Paul does not mean any false god, but the true God who makes everything that is alive to be alive. Paul also connects the "good confession" that Timothy made with the "good confession" that Christ Jesus made when he was on trial in Pontius Pilate's court.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How does your culture make things like buying or selling property or marriages official? Think about what actions people have to take and what people have to be present at those events. What happens if someone does not honor his commitments? Pause this audio here.

Then Paul gives Timothy the command to obey the things that Paul has just commanded Timothy. By telling Timothy that Paul wants Timothy to do it without spot or blame, Paul says that Timothy should obey perfectly and stay completely faithful to the good news and the confession that Jesus is King. Paul wants Timothy to keep obeying until the unknown time in the future when the Lord Jesus Christ will reappear to the world. Only God knows when that time will be.

Part three starts when Paul suddenly begins to praise God. This may have been a song that was common in the early church. Paul starts by saying that God is the ultimate and highest ruler in three different ways: God is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings, and the Lord of lords. These titles emphasize God's supreme authority and power over all rulers and powers.

Stop here and discuss as a group: How would you translate these three titles for God in your language? Think about how to convey the three ideas of:

* God is the blessed and only Sovereign, which means God is the source of all blessings.
* God is the King of kings, which means that God has absolute power and authority.
* God is the Lord of lords, which means that he is above all earthly rulers and authorities.

Consider if there are any traditional titles or phrases in your culture that could show these concepts. Pause this audio here.

Then Paul continues by listing some of God's other unique characteristics, things that make God completely different from anything that God created. Paul says that God deserves all the honor and authority or power that he has because God is immortal, which means God has no beginning and no end. Unlike all created beings, God's existence is eternal. God "dwells in unapproachable light." In other words, God is holy and glorious. God's presence is so pure and bright that no sinful human can approach God directly. No one has seen or can see God. While God has revealed himself in various ways, we can never fully understand God's nature. These characteristics of God emphasize how God is above and beyond all creation. These characteristics show why God is worthy of all praise and honor.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How would you describe these characteristics of God in your language? How would these descriptions affect people's ideas about God as opposed to any other kind of spirits they may believe in? Pause this audio here.

The last word Paul says is "amen," which is an exclamation meaning something like, "What I just said is really true!"

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What would you say in order to reinforce that what you just said was really true? Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. As you show the things that happen in this part of the letter, choose objects to represent Paul, Timothy, God, Christ Jesus, Pilate, and many witnesses. As Paul gives Timothy these instructions, imagine that Timothy is at the beginning of a race or competition. God, Christ Jesus, and other witnesses watch Timothy, and everyone encourages Timothy to run the race well. Perhaps Timothy remembers when Christ Jesus said to Pilate, "I am King." Timothy remembers when he said, "Jesus is King." As Timothy remembers these things, he looks to God and sees that God is wonderful. Timothy praises God!

Embodying the Text
------------------

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 6:11–16 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* Many witnesses
* God
* Christ Jesus
* And Pontius Pilate

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

As the scene starts, someone who acts as Paul points to a person who acts as Timothy, because Paul speaks to Timothy, the man of God, very directly. Then Timothy runs away from things that represent the bad things, and he runs toward the good things that God says to do. Timothy fights against those bad things and holds tight to something that represents eternal life.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* This is hard! or
* I am glad I have something to trust in.

We see Jesus, who is on trial, say to Pontius Pilate, "I am King." Then the person who plays Timothy stands in front of a crowd and says, "Jesus is King." Two people who Timothy cannot see, God and Jesus, watch Timothy.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Jesus, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I was faithful and I will help Timothy be faithful; or
* Follow my example, Timothy.

Timothy runs the race well. Timothy is completely clean, with no spot on him, because Timothy is faithful and follows God's commands. Then God brings Jesus suddenly to the scene, and God appears with Jesus in a very bright light. No one can come near God. Kings and rulers bow to God as they honor God and praise him.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* There is no one like this! I will do what Paul commands me to do! or
* I am glad I obeyed, at least most of the time. I am a little nervous about the times I was not as faithful as I could have been. But Jesus has welcomed me anyway, and that is amazing! or
* I am so glad Jesus has come!

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 6:11–16 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul gives a list of good ways that the man of God, or Timothy, should live. Timothy should look for **righteousness**. This means that Timothy should do the things that God says are right, or things that are righteous. Use a similar word to righteous as you used in previous passages in 1 Timothy. Look up righteousness in the Master Glossary for more information.

Timothy should also look for **godliness**. Godliness means to act and think like God wants someone to. Use the same word or phrase for godliness as you used in previous passages. Look up godly in the Master Glossary for more information.

Timothy should also act with **faith** and **love**. To have faith means to always trust God. Timothy should love God and love other people. Use the same words or phrases for faith and love as you used in previous passages. Look up faith in the Master Glossary for more information.

Timothy should act with **steadfastness** or **endurance**. This means that Timothy should continue to work or try even when things are very hard or people try to stop Timothy or make things difficult. Timothy should be patient with people and endure when hard things happen. Timothy should not get annoyed with people or when things do not happen at the time or in the way Timothy wants them to. A steadfast person is dependable.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **steadfastness**, or continuing to work even when things are hard. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same words that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Timothy should act with **gentleness**. A gentle person is kind to the weak and does not like to fight people. Instead, a gentle person should consider people's needs.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **gentleness**. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same words that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul tells Timothy to grab on to **eternal life**. Eternal life means a life with God that will never end. Use the same word or phrase for eternal life as you used in previous passages. Look up eternal life in the Master Glossary for more information.

Paul tells Timothy to remember making the **good confession**. The good confession means to say something true. It also means to promise to follow this truth. The truth is that Jesus is King. Paul says that **Christ** Jesus **testified** before Pontius Pilate and made this same good confession. To testify or to bear witness means to declare the truth about something from one's own experience. Use the same word for Christ that you have used in previous passages. Look up Christ and testimony in the Master Glossary for more information.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **good confession** and **testimony**. If you have already translated these words in another book of the Bible, use the same words that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Use the same word for Christ that you have used in previous passages, and look up Christ in the Master Glossary for more information.

The **appearing** of the Lord Jesus Christ refers to the future end of the world when Jesus will return.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **appearing**. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same words that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul starts his list of praises of God by saying that God is **blessed**. Use the same word or phrase for blessed as you used in previous passages. Look up bless in the Master Glossary for more information. Then he gives titles like "king of kings" and "lord of lords" that all mean that God is the highest ruler, over every other ruler there could be. Look up king and lord in the Master Glossary for more information, and use the same words for king and lord that you have used in previous passages. Paul says that God is **immortal**. That means that he has no beginning or end, he cannot die.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **immortal** or **immortality**. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same words that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Finally Paul calls on anyone who might hear to honor God and prays that God would rule forever. He ends with the word **amen**. Use the same words for amen that you have used in previous passages. Look up amen in the Master Glossary for more information.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 6:17–21 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

Paul is nearing the end of his letter to Timothy. Paul has given Timothy many instructions about how to lead the church in Ephesus. Now, Paul gives Timothy some final advice about how to instruct wealthy believers in the church. Paul continues to show a contrast between the riches that some people wanted and true riches. True riches are life with God forever that a believer receives when that believer wants to follow God more than they want anything else.

In the ancient world, many people thought that if someone was wealthy, God was pleased with that person. Some wealthy Christians in Ephesus may have thought their riches meant God approved of them more than God approved of others. Paul wants to correct this misunderstanding. Paul instructs Timothy to teach the rich believers how to use their wealth properly.

Ephesus was a prosperous city, and some members of the church there were quite wealthy. Paul wants to warn these rich Christians that they will find it hard to think the right way about money and to do what they should with their money. Paul wants to make sure these people do not place their hope in their riches, which can quickly disappear. Instead, these Christians should put their hope in God, who provides everything we need.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, how do people think about wealthy people? How do people think money affects their relationship with God? How might wealth create problems for believers? Pause this audio here.

Paul reminds the wealthy believers that God gives us everything for our enjoyment. God actually gives us more than we need! This shows that having money and possessions is not wrong in itself. The problem comes when people trust in their wealth instead of in God.

Paul then gives practical instructions on how rich believers should use their wealth. These believers should do good deeds, be generous, and share with others. By doing this, the believers store up treasure for themselves for the coming age. Here, Paul is talking about eternal life—the life that continues beyond our earthly existence. This eternal life is what Paul calls "truly life" or "the life that is really life." Paul means that by using their wealth for good and being generous, rich believers invest in their eternal future. These believers build a strong spiritual foundation that will last beyond this present life. However, at the same time, rich believers have a full life here on this earth! These believers follow God when they are generous, which means that their life here is full of joy!

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your community, how do people with more resources typically use their wealth? What are some ways people can be generous with what they have? How do people prepare for the future? How might preparing for eternal life be similar or different? Pause this audio here.

Finally, Paul urges Timothy to guard something that someone entrusted to Timothy. Most likely, Paul is telling Timothy to continue to teach well the true gospel message about Jesus. Paul entrusted Timothy with these teachings, which means that Paul trusted that Timothy would teach these doctrines well. Paul warns against godless chatter, or talking over and over about things not from God. Sometimes people talk about ideas that people think are important knowledge, even though those things are not really true. In Ephesus, there were false teachers who promoted their own ideas as special knowledge. Paul uses special language to describe those who have followed false teachings. Paul says these people have "departed from the faith" or "wandered from the faith," like someone who has strayed off the correct path and gotten lost. Paul wants Timothy to stay on the right path by guarding the true gospel and avoiding wrong ideas.

Paul finishes the letter with a common blessing. Paul asks God to show grace, or to show the Ephesian church God's favor even though they do not deserve it!

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 6:17–21 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has two parts.

**In the first part:** Paul gives Timothy instructions on how to teach wealthy believers in the church.

**In the second part:** Paul gives Timothy a final warning and encouragement to guard the true gospel.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul, who is the writer
* Timothy, who is the recipient
* Rich believers in the Ephesian church
* And God

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In the first part, Paul gives Timothy specific instructions for a particular group in the church—those who are rich. Paul wants Timothy to command these people not to be arrogant or hope in wealth. These people should not trust money because money could go away at any time. Instead, these people should hope in God. Paul describes God as one who gives us everything for our enjoyment.

Paul then gives some commands to wealthy people. Paul tells these people to do good, and even more: Paul tells these people to do lots and lots of good deeds, to be generous, and to be willing to share.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How would you act out each of these types of riches? For example, how would you show someone who is rich in money versus someone who is rich in good deeds? How would you act out each of these commands? What actions would show someone doing each of these things? Pause this audio here.

Paul explains that by following these commands in this present age, the wealthy believers will "lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age." This means that these believers' present actions will have consequences for their future with God forever. Paul contrasts "this present age" with "the coming age."

Stop here and discuss these questions as a group: Have one person represent "this present age" and another represent "the coming age." How would each person stand or move? What would they say? How would you show the difference between how a person puts hope in wealth, or the present age, versus how that person stores up treasure for the coming age? Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss as a group: In your culture, how do people build foundations for houses or buildings? Look at the picture of a foundation. What makes a foundation strong and lasting? How is that similar to or different from the way Paul uses this idea in this passage? Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss as a group: What do you think Paul means by "the life that is truly life"? How is this different from ordinary life? Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss as a group: In your language, how would you express the idea of "taking hold" of something that is not physical, like life? This means that someone fully lives in a way that follows God and is fully devoted to God. Try a few different ways and see which one best captures the idea of firmly grasping true life. Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul shifts his focus to Timothy himself. Paul tells Timothy to protect the true gospel message about Jesus that Paul taught Timothy.

Paul warns Timothy to turn away from talk that dishonors God or God's truth and ideas that people think are true knowledge but are really against the truth.

Paul says that some people have trusted these things instead of God and have wandered from the faith. This shows that it is a serious thing to trust in anything other than God himself.

Paul ends with a brief closing blessing, asking for grace, or God's undeserved favor, to be with Timothy and the believers.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. You might want to have objects to represent rich people and their money or wealth. Consider how you can show the contrast between how people put hope in wealth versus how they put hope in God. Also, think about how to represent the idea of "storing treasure" in heaven through good deeds and generosity. How can you show that good deeds and being generous make more treasure in heaven?

Embodying the Text

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 6:17–21 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has two parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul, who is the writer
* Timothy, who is the recipient
* Rich believers in the Ephesian church
* And God

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

In part one, Paul is writing a letter to Timothy. Paul gives Timothy instructions for the rich people. Paul tells Timothy to tell these people not to hope for good things to come from their riches, but to hope that good things will come from God.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am concerned about the wealthy believers in Ephesus. I want to make sure these believers understand that their riches do not make them better than others; or
* I am worried that some rich believers might trust in their wealth more than in God.

Paul continues by commanding the rich people to do lots of good things and to share the blessings they have because they are rich. Paul tells these believers to do this because they will have a big treasure in the next age. In this way, these believers invest in heaven, the place where they will live forever, not just in this age.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am grateful for Paul's guidance on how to instruct the wealthy members of our church; or
* I am a bit nervous about how the rich believers will receive these instructions.

Ask the person who plays a rich believer, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might say:

* I feel challenged. I never thought about using my wealth this way before; or
* I am not sure I want to be so generous with my money.

In part two, Paul instructs Timothy to be faithful to the good message about Jesus and to be careful not to talk about useless things or to follow bad ideas that cause people to stop believing in Jesus.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel the weight of responsibility to protect the true gospel; or
* I am concerned about the false teachings that threaten our church.

Paul finishes with, "Grace be with you all."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person who plays Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I hope Timothy understands how important it is to stay true to the gospel; or
* I pray for God's grace to be with Timothy and all the believers in Ephesus as they face these challenges.

Listen to an audio version of 1 Timothy 6:17–21 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul tells the rich to put their **hope** in God rather than in wealth. Use the same word or phrase for hope that you used earlier in 1 Timothy. For more information on hope, refer to the Master Glossary.

Paul instructs the rich to do good and be rich in **good deeds**. Good deeds are actions that benefit others and please God. Use the same phrase for good deeds that you used earlier in 1 Timothy.

Paul tells the rich to be **generous** and willing to share. When someone is generous, they give a lot of money or things to help others.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will translate this concept of being generous. Pause this audio here.

Paul says that by doing these things, the rich believers will **lay up treasure**, or store treasure, for themselves. This is special language that means to gather together or store something valuable for the future.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will translate this concept of "laying up treasure." Pause this audio here.

Paul refers to the **coming age**, which means the future time when God fully establishes his kingdom when Jesus returns to rule. For more information, look up kingdom of God in the Master Glossary and pay attention to the parts that talk about the future perfect kingdom.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will translate this concept of "the coming age." Pause this audio here.

Paul mentions what people falsely call **knowledge**. This refers to teachings that claim to be true but are actually false. Use the same word for knowledge that you used earlier in 1 Timothy.

Finally, Paul says some have wandered from the **faith**. This gives a picture of someone who walks off the right path. Use the same word for faith that you used in previous passages. For more information on faith, refer to the Master Glossary.

Paul says goodbye by asking God to give **grace** to Timothy and the believers in Ephesus. Use the same word for grace that you have used previously, and look up grace in the Master Glossary for more information.

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 1:1–5 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

This passage is the introduction to a letter that Paul wrote to Timothy. Paul was one of the leaders of the early Christian church. When Paul writes this letter, Paul is in prison in Rome and near the end of his life. Timothy is leading the Ephesian church, and Paul is writing to encourage Timothy to remain faithful to the truth of the good news and to confront false teachers within the church. In Paul's time, someone normally spoke the message of the letter, and someone else wrote the letter down. This is probably how Paul wrote this letter to Timothy. In Paul's time, someone begins a letter by including the name of the author, the name of the receiver, and a greeting.

Stop here as a group and look at a map that includes Ephesus and Rome. Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss as a group: When you send a message to someone you love very much, how do you do it? How do you start your message? Pause this audio here.

In the first part of the letter, Paul identifies himself as the author. Paul says that God chose Paul to be an apostle for Christ Jesus. You will remember from Acts that God revealed himself to Paul, whose name at that time was still Saul, on the road to Damascus, and Paul decided to follow Jesus. God chose and sent Paul as an apostle to share the good news with all people, especially non\-Jews. Paul says that God sent Paul out to tell others about the life God has promised through faith in Christ Jesus. Paul's ministry is directly connected to God's plan of salvation for the world. Paul's missionary calling is to tell others about the eternal life that God has promised and given to all who are connected to Christ Jesus.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do people talk about their work or their roles in your culture? Pause this audio here.

Paul is writing this letter to Timothy, his "dear son." You will remember from Acts that Paul chose Timothy to travel with Paul and help Paul in his missionary work. Paul chose Timothy because Timothy had a good reputation and because other Christian prophets confirmed that Timothy should work with Paul. Timothy was one of Paul's closest coworkers. Paul often sent Timothy to various churches to lead and correct the churches. Through years of ministry together, Paul and Timothy soon had a relationship that was much like a loving father and son would have. Paul shows that he loves and approves of Timothy.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about someone you know who is not a member of your family, but whom you love like they are a member of your family, or like they are one of your children. How does your culture describe strong, loving relationships between those who are not your own children? Pause this audio here.

Paul then offers a typical Christian greeting to Timothy. Paul prays that God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord would give Timothy grace, mercy, and peace. Unlike Paul's other letters, Paul prays for mercy, or kindness and compassion, for Timothy. Paul prays for mercy for Timothy because Timothy is in a difficult situation in the Ephesian church. Timothy will need God's mercy to remain strong and faithful to the truth of the gospel against the false teachers in the Ephesian church.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What are common greetings in your language? How would you say a blessing to someone? How do you change the blessings you give someone based on their situation? Pause this audio here.

Paul then thanks God for Timothy. In Paul's time, writers of letters would often thank God after they greeted the people. Paul thanks God that Paul serves God just like Paul's ancestors before him served God. Paul says that Paul has served God with a clear conscience, just as Paul's ancestors served God with a clear conscience. In other words, Paul believes that Paul has been faithful to the tasks God has given Paul. As Paul looks back on his life of ministry, Paul does not feel shame. Paul prays for Timothy on a regular basis, and Paul longs to see Timothy again. Paul remembers the time he left Timothy, which you will remember from Paul's first letter to Timothy. Paul remembers that Timothy cried when Paul left Timothy.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Talk about a time when a man cried. When is it appropriate or inappropriate to cry in your culture? Pause this audio here.

As Paul sees his own faith to be like the faith of his ancestors, Paul says Timothy's faith is like the faith of Timothy's grandmother and mother. Paul reminds Timothy of Timothy's ancestors who were faithful. Paul wants to remind Timothy that Timothy should be faithful just like Timothy's ancestors were, because Timothy is going to continue Paul's work after Paul's death.

Defining the Scenes

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 1:1–5 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has two parts.

**In the first part:** Paul starts the letter and says who wrote the letter and to whom the letter is written. Paul then greets Timothy.

**In the second part:** Paul then offers thanksgiving to God for Timothy. Paul shares how often Paul prays for Timothy and how Paul desires to see Timothy again. Paul sees the same faith of Timothy's grandmother and mother within Timothy himself.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* Timothy's grandmother, Lois
* Timothy's mother, Eunice
* Christ Jesus
* And God

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

It is important to remember that this passage is the introduction to a letter that Paul sends to Timothy. This letter is similar to Paul's first letter to Timothy and Paul's letter to Titus. Paul also starts this letter in a similar way to other letters. Remember that the three main parts of a letter introduction during Paul's time are the name of the person who sends the letter, the name of the person who receives the letter, and a greeting. After the greeting, letters typically include a thanksgiving section.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Practice introducing yourself when you send a message to someone. What kinds of information do you give to your audience? Remember how you translated the introduction of Paul's previous letters. Pause this audio here.

In the first scene, Paul introduces himself as the writer of the letter to Timothy. Paul calls himself "an apostle of Christ Jesus," who is "chosen by the will of God." Paul also says what God called Paul to do. God called Paul to share the good news with all people. Paul shows his authority as an apostle to pass on his ministry to Timothy. Paul is not making Timothy an apostle, but Paul is calling Timothy to lead the churches in Ephesus.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How will you show the speaker's authority in the message? Pause this audio here.

Paul knows that Paul will die soon. Paul is writing his final letter to his dear son, Timothy. You will remember that Paul is writing to Timothy to encourage Timothy to remain faithful to the truth of the gospel and to confront false teachers in the Ephesian church.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How would Paul's emotions affect the way Paul talks to Timothy? Although Timothy is not Paul's son, Paul calls Timothy a son in this greeting. How do you address someone who is not your child but whom you love as if they were your child? Pause this audio here.

In this thanksgiving section, Paul gives thanks to God for Timothy and for Timothy's strong faith. Paul remembers Timothy "night and day," or regularly, in Paul's prayers. Paul loves Timothy so much that Paul prays for Timothy on a regular basis.

Stop here and discuss as a group: How do you talk about doing something regularly or often? Pause this audio here.

Paul very much wants to see Timothy. Paul remembers that Timothy cried when Paul left. Paul says that if Paul sees Timothy, Paul will be full of joy.

Stop here and discuss as a group: Tell a story about a time you wanted to see someone very much and you imagined how you would feel if you were able to see that person. How do you talk about being full of joy or very happy when you get to see someone you love? Pause this audio here.

Paul thinks about Paul's ancestry. Paul connects his own ministry with the Old Testament and to Paul's Jewish ancestors. Paul sees that his ministry is directly connected to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Paul connects his ministry to Paul's ancestors to show the authority and faithfulness of Paul's ministry. Paul is passing on his faithful ministry to Timothy. Paul is faithful to God just like Paul's ancestors were. In the same way, God calls Timothy to be faithful to God, just like Timothy's mother and grandmother were faithful. Paul says that Timothy's faith, or trust in Jesus, lives inside of Timothy, just like this faith lived inside of Timothy's mother and grandmother. In other words, Timothy acts in such a way as to show that Timothy truly trusts Jesus.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Why would someone in your culture talk about their ancestors? Pause this audio here.

Remember that this is Paul's final letter to his "dear son" Timothy. Think about how you would feel if you were writing a final letter to someone you considered to be like your child. What emotions would you show? What kinds of things would you want to talk about?

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 1:1–5 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has two parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* Timothy's grandmother, Lois
* Timothy's mother, Eunice
* Christ Jesus
* And God

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

In the first scene, Paul begins Paul's letter to his dear son, Timothy. Paul identifies himself as "chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus." Paul reflects on Paul's purpose as an apostle. Paul says that Jesus sent Paul to tell others about the eternal life that people can receive through faith in Christ Jesus.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling right now as you send this letter to your dear son before your death?" The person might answer:

* I am feeling both joy and sadness. I long to see Timothy again, especially as I remember how Timothy cried as we left one another; or
* I am also feeling joy, because I know Timothy will faithfully continue my work. I am confident in Timothy's ability to lead and teach the church as I have.

Ask the person playing Timothy, "What are you feeling right now as you receive this final letter from your spiritual father, Paul?" You may hear:

* I am feeling sad as I think about how Paul will soon die. Paul has been like a father to me. I am also feeling intimidated. Paul has taught me well, but I feel the burden of this calling. The Ephesian church is having difficulties and is full of false teachers; or
* I am grateful to receive this letter from Paul and to be encouraged by Paul. I know I can do this through the power of the Holy Spirit.

Paul then greets Timothy. Paul prays that Timothy will receive grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord.

In the second scene, Paul thanks God for Paul's dear son Timothy. Paul reflects on his service for God. Paul has served God with a clear conscience, just as Paul's ancestors served God.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Paul, "How are you feeling right now as you reflect on your life's work?" You may hear:

* I am honored to serve God just as many others have served God in the past; or
* I am grateful that God used me to share the gospel and to grow God's church.

Paul then tells Timothy that Paul prays for Timothy night and day. Paul then expresses Paul's strong desire to see Timothy again. Paul remembers the last time Paul was together with Timothy, and Paul remembers the emotions when Paul and Timothy parted ways.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Timothy, "What are you thinking or feeling right now as Paul gives thanks for you and says that Paul prays for you night and day?" You might hear:

* I am grateful to know my spiritual father prays for me day and night; or
* It fills me with joy to know that Paul loves me so much.

Paul then reflects on Timothy's faith. Timothy shares the same faith as his grandmother Lois and his mother Eunice. The same faith within his grandmother and mother continues strong within Timothy.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Lois and the person playing Eunice, "What are you feeling right now as you consider Timothy's faith and life?" You may hear:

* I am feeling proud of my son; or
* I am so grateful that Timothy shares my faith in Christ Jesus; or
* I am excited to see how God will use Timothy.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul identifies himself as an **apostle** of **Christ** Jesus. An apostle is someone who has received special authority from Jesus. Apostles are able to make decisions about spiritual matters and speak with authority on behalf of Jesus.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **apostle**. Look up apostle in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

**Christ** means Messiah. The Messiah is the promised king and savior of the world, whom God has specially anointed.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **Christ**. Look up Christ in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul then greets Timothy in a typical way. Paul prays that God the Father and Christ Jesus our **Lord** would give grace, mercy, and peace to Timothy. A Lord is someone who is a master over other people. A Lord has full authority and deserves respect from people. Jesus is Lord because Jesus has authority over the whole world.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **lord**. Look up lord in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

When someone shows us **grace**, that person does something good for us or gives us something good that we do not deserve. All people have disobeyed God, and all people deserve to be separated from God. God shows grace to people because God loves those people. God forgives those people for their sins and makes them God's children, even though people do not deserve it.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will describe **grace**. Look up grace in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this idea in another book of the Bible, use the same description that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul also prays that Timothy would receive **mercy**. Unlike Paul's other greetings, Paul adds mercy to this prayer. When someone shows mercy, they show goodness, kindness, or compassion to someone. God shows mercy to God's people by having pity on those people and helping them.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will describe **mercy**. Look up mercy in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this idea in another book of the Bible, use the same description that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul also prays for **peace**. When someone experiences peace, that person experiences the absence of conflict and a fullness in life. People also experience peace when they live together in unity and love one another.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will describe **peace**. Look up peace in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this idea in another book of the Bible, use the same description that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul says he has a clear **conscience**, which means that Paul believes Paul has obeyed God and acted in a way God wants Paul to act. Paul does not feel ashamed or guilty for anything Paul has done.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will describe Paul's clear **conscience**. Look up conscience in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this idea in another book of the Bible, use the same description for conscience that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul constantly remembers Timothy in Paul's **prayers**. In other words, Paul talks to God about Timothy.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will describe Paul's **prayers**. Look up pray in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated the idea of prayer in another book of the Bible, use the same description for prayer that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul remembers Timothy's **faith**. When someone has faith, that person believes in something. If you believe in someone, you believe that what that person says about himself is true. You then trust that person and are committed to doing what that person tells you to do. We can only receive eternal life if we have faith or trust in Jesus Christ as our king and savior.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will describe **faith**. Look up faith in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this idea in another book of the Bible, use the same description that you have used there.

Setting the Stage

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 1:6–14 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

You will remember that Paul is writing to Timothy to encourage Timothy in Timothy's faith. In the passage before this one, Paul is reminded of Timothy's strong faith. Paul wants Timothy to continue to lead the church well and to continue to teach the message of the good news. As Paul remembers Timothy's faith, Paul encourages Timothy "to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands." God gave Timothy a special ability so that Timothy could serve God and help other believers in Ephesus. It is this gift that Paul encourages Timothy to keep burning brightly, just as a person would keep a fire burning brightly. Paul is not saying that Timothy's faith is weak. Paul wants to encourage Timothy to continue to serve to the best of Timothy's ability.

God empowered Timothy with a special ability to lead the churches at Ephesus when Paul laid Paul's hands on Timothy. The believers laid their hands on people to bless those people and to appoint those people for a specific task. The believers most likely laid their hands on someone's head. You will remember how believers used to lay their hands on people's heads in stories in the book of Acts. You will also remember how Paul talked about laying hands on Timothy in Paul's first letter to Timothy. The event Paul mentions in the first and second letters to Timothy is probably the same event. When he laid hands on Timothy, Paul publicly appointed and sent out Timothy to serve the church in Ephesus.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How would you show that you were blessing or appointing someone in your culture or your church for an important task? How appropriate or inappropriate would it be to lay hands on someone in your culture? Pause this audio here.

Paul reminded Timothy that God gave Timothy this gift. We do not know exactly what this gift is, but it may be a spiritual gift or special ability to help Timothy teach and serve the believers.

Now, Paul reminds Timothy more about what God has given to Timothy. Paul says that God does not give us a spirit of fear. God gives us a spirit of power, love, and self\-control. Some people think Paul talks about a person's spirit, but some people think that Paul means the Holy Spirit. A person's spirit is the invisible inner part of a person that thinks, feels, and desires. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit lives in and works in the believers, in their hearts and spirits, to help the believers behave more like Jesus. Either way, both of these mean that God causes the believer's spirits, or the believers, not to be afraid. Instead, God gives believers spiritual power, which means God causes the believers to be strong. This power causes believers to endure difficult circumstances and continue to be faithful to God. God causes believers to love and care for one another. God gives believers self\-control. A person who has self\-control has good judgment and can act in a responsible way. This person is able to control the way he thinks or behaves.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about someone you know who knows how to control their actions well. What do other people think about this person? Pause this audio here.

God has given Timothy this nature of power, love, and self\-control through the Holy Spirit. Because of this, Paul then encourages Timothy not to feel shame because of the good news of Jesus. Instead, God's power will cause Timothy to be able to be strong when Timothy suffers because Timothy has shared the good news of Jesus. Paul also encourages Timothy not to feel shame about Paul himself. Prisoners were normally people who had committed crimes, so most people were ashamed of a friend or relative who was in prison. Some people even rejected the good news of Jesus because they knew that Paul was in prison. But Paul says that Paul is the Lord's prisoner. Paul is in prison because Paul believes in the Lord Jesus and shares the good news. Paul encourages Timothy to suffer with Paul with the strength that God gives to Timothy. Paul wants Timothy to be loyal and faithful to Jesus.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What kinds of things cause officials to put people in prison in your community? How do people feel when someone they know is in prison? What do people think about a person who is in prison? Pause this audio here.

Paul then reminds Timothy of the message of the good news when Paul reminds Timothy of the words of a hymn. Paul says that God saves us from sin and calls us to live a holy life. A holy life is a life that God has set apart for God's special purposes. God saves us because God loves us and chooses to give us grace. We did not do anything to earn the way God saves us. God planned to save us even before God created the world. God has now revealed the way God will save us through Jesus. Jesus defeated the power death has over people. Jesus showed how people can have eternal life forever with God through the message of the good news.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Paul said this explanation of the good news in a saying or song that everyone would have known. When a teacher tells very good news or important teaching in a religious setting, how do they tell it? How do teachers help people remember important truths? Pause this audio here.

Jesus sent Paul to share this good news as a herald, apostle, and teacher. A herald is a person that a king or some other important leader has sent to tell a message publicly. An apostle is someone who received special authority from Jesus to speak on Jesus' behalf and to represent Christ Jesus to others. Paul also taught people the good news and other truths about the faith. Paul is in prison because Paul faithfully shares the good news. Paul is not ashamed of the good news, though. Paul knows and trusts in Jesus, and Paul knows that Jesus will protect the message of the good news until Jesus comes back at the end of time to judge whether people have followed God or not. Paul cannot teach the gospel like Paul used to when Paul was free. But Paul is confident that Jesus will cause others to continue to teach the gospel until Jesus returns. Jesus will also cause people to remember the true gospel and not confuse the gospel with something that is not true.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, when a leader has an important message for his people, what kind of person does the leader choose to share his message? What authority does the leader give to this person? Pause this audio here.

You will remember that Paul knows Paul is going to die soon. Paul now calls Timothy to continue the task of Paul's faithful ministry. Paul encourages Timothy to remain faithful to the good news about Jesus, which Timothy has learned from Paul himself. As Timothy does this, Timothy should continue to believe in Jesus and love others because Timothy is united with Christ Jesus. Paul encourages Timothy to protect the message of the good news. The Holy Spirit will help Timothy because the Holy Spirit lives with believers.

Defining the Scenes

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 1:6–14 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul reminds Timothy of what God has given to Timothy. Paul encourages Timothy to remain faithful.

**In the second part:** Paul reminds Timothy that God saved us and called us to live a holy life. God did this through Christ Jesus, who had power over death and showed us how to have life with God forever.

**In the third part:** Paul uses Paul's own life as an example for Timothy. Timothy should follow the pattern of Paul's ministry and faithfulness.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* Holy Spirit
* God the Father
* And Christ Jesus

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

It is important to remember that this part of the letter follows the introduction and greeting to Timothy. Paul writes directly to Timothy to encourage and instruct Timothy. Remember that Paul writes from prison and that Paul expects to die soon. Paul wants to encourage Timothy because Timothy serves the struggling churches in Ephesus. Paul wants Timothy to remain faithful in the difficult situation at Ephesus.

In the first part, Paul encourages Timothy to fully use Timothy's gift. Paul encourages Timothy to stir up Timothy's gift as one would stir a fire to increase its heat and strength. God gave this gift to Timothy when Paul laid his hands on Timothy. You will remember that the early believers most likely laid their hands on someone's head as a symbol of blessing and calling to ministry.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do you talk about the way people make a fire and keep a fire going in your language? Imagine someone was able to do something very well, such as cook very well or run very fast, but then that person stopped doing that thing. How would you encourage that person to revive or begin to fully use their abilities again? Discuss how you will translate the way that Paul compares Timothy's gift to a fire and encourages Timothy. Pause this audio here.

Timothy should continue to use his gift from God, because God gives believers the ability to act and think with power, love, and self\-control. God gives the believers this good spirit, which can be their human spirit or the Holy Spirit who lives in the believers. When Paul reminds Timothy of how God prepared Timothy to serve and lead the believers, Paul encourages Timothy to not be ashamed of his faith but to be ready to suffer for the gospel.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Discuss how you want to translate the spirit here. How do you talk about what kind of person someone is? For example, what makes someone a good person? How do you know that someone loves other people or acts in a self\-controlled way? Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul reminds Timothy of what God has done. Paul says this as a hymn or a song that would be easy for Timothy or other believers to repeat and remember. God saves God's people by grace alone. God had a plan to save God's people before God created the world. God showed God's plan clearly through the life of Jesus. Paul reminds Timothy that God saves us so that we can live a holy life. This life is different than our lives used to be because now we live our lives completely for God. Jesus showed us the way to receive eternal life through the message of the good news.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How would you briefly share the main parts of the good news with someone in your language? In your language, how do you talk about songs that teach important ideas? How do you say important ideas in a way that is easy for people to remember, while still including all the important parts of the idea? Pause this audio here.

In the third scene, Paul explains the reason Paul is in prison. God chose Paul to live as a preacher or herald, as well as an apostle and a teacher of the good news. Paul is in prison because Paul teaches the good news, but Paul is not ashamed because Paul knows and trusts Jesus. Paul knows that Jesus will protect the message that Jesus gave to Paul. Paul talks about Jesus protecting or guarding Paul's life and Paul's message like a person carefully protects something that someone gives to that person.

Stop here and discuss as a group: How will you talk about how Jesus guards what Paul gives to Jesus? Paul probably trusts Jesus to guard Paul's life and Paul's message. This means that Jesus can do whatever Jesus thinks is best with Paul's life and Paul's message. Pause this audio here.

Paul then instructs Timothy to protect that same message that Paul has given to Timothy. Timothy can protect the message of the good news through the power of the Holy Spirit, who helps believers.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your language, how do you talk about the way that people continue to teach and believe a true message and not change the message, or start to believe a different message? Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Embodying the Text
------------------

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 1:6–14 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* Holy Spirit
* God the Father
* And Christ Jesus

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul wants Timothy to continue to be faithful, so Paul encourages Timothy to continue to fully use Timothy's gift. God gave Timothy this gift when Paul laid his hands on Timothy.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Timothy, "What are you feeling right now as Paul reminds you about when Paul laid hands on you?" The person might answer:

* I remember how important this responsibility is; or
* I feel more confident and encouraged when I remember this moment.

Paul then tells Timothy that God gives believers the ability to think and act with power, love, and self\-control. Believers do not need to think and act with fear.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling right now as you encourage Timothy?" The person might answer:

* Timothy is like a dear son to me. I want to see Timothy stay faithful to the Lord; or
* I am confident the Lord will continue to use Timothy.

Paul then tells Timothy to not be ashamed about Jesus or even Paul, who is a prisoner. Instead, Paul tells Timothy to be ready to suffer for the good news with the strength God gives Timothy.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Timothy, "How are you feeling right now as Paul tells you to not be ashamed but ready to suffer for the good news?" The person might answer:

* I am afraid, but I trust Jesus; or
* I am not ashamed. I feel honored that God will use me like God uses Paul; or
* I want to be as confident as Paul is!

Paul then reminds Timothy of the message of the good news. Paul reminds Timothy that God saves people because of God's grace, not because of anything we do on our own. God had a plan to save people before God ever created the world. God showed people grace when God sent Jesus to the world. Jesus removed the power of death and brought eternal life for those who trust in Jesus.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Paul and the person playing Timothy, "How are you feeling right now as you are reminded of the good news?" The person playing Paul might answer:

* I feel joy that Jesus has saved me and that I get to live forever with Jesus; or
* I feel honored to suffer for such an important message.

The person playing Timothy might answer:

* This message is important, so I am honored to receive this message from Paul and to pass this message on to others; or
* This good news brings me so much joy and boldness; or
* This message helps me not be afraid.

Paul then shares about Paul's own life and ministry as an example to Timothy. God chose Paul to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the good news. Paul is in prison because Paul preached and taught the message of the good news. Paul is not ashamed, though, because Paul knows and trusts Jesus. Paul knows that Jesus will protect the message of the good news.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling right now?" The person might answer:

* I am so glad that I know Jesus, even though I suffer in prison; or
* It is an honor to suffer for the good news, because Jesus suffered for the good news, too.

Paul then tells Timothy to continue to keep the same message that Paul taught to Timothy. As Timothy does this, Timothy should continue to trust Christ and love others. Timothy must carefully protect the message of the good news with the help of the Holy Spirit.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer:

* I am encouraged to know that the Holy Spirit will help me serve God faithfully; or
* I feel grateful that Paul has been my teacher.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 1:6–14 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul reminds Timothy to use the **gift** God gave to Timothy. This gift may be a spiritual gift or a special ability that God gave to Timothy. This gift may be the ability to serve as a leader.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **gift**, or the special ability God gave to Timothy. Look up gift in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul talks about the **spirit** that God gave to the believers. This spirit could be the Holy Spirit or a person's spirit. God created people with a body, and we can touch and see each other's bodies. But God also created people with thoughts, feelings, and desires. We cannot see this part of a person, but we know it is there. This invisible part of a person in the Bible is often called a spirit. When the Bible uses the word spirit, the focus is on the relationship that a person has with God. When we are praying, our spirit is talking with God. When someone who believes in Jesus dies, their spirit will continue to live with God.

The **Holy Spirit** is the Spirit of God. Sometimes the Bible calls this just the Spirit. The Holy Spirit makes it possible for people to become followers of Jesus. When people start to follow Jesus, the Holy Spirit works in those people's hearts to help them to behave more and more like Jesus, to make them more and more holy. The Holy Spirit is not just a power, but is also a person himself. At the end of this passage, Paul says the Holy Spirit helps believers and lives with believers.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **spirit** at the beginning of this passage and for the **Holy Spirit** at the end. Look up spirit and Holy Spirit in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated these words in another book of the Bible, use the same words that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul tells Timothy not to be ashamed about the **testimony** of the Lord, or to be ashamed to **testify** about the Lord. When someone gives a testimony, this means that the person tells something that the person knows is really true. A person who gives a testimony is someone who testifies.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **testimony** or **testify**. Look up testimony in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul calls Jesus "**Lord**." A lord is a master over other people, who has full authority, so people used this word for God, because God has authority over the whole world. Paul often called Jesus "Lord" to remind people that Jesus is God, too. For more information on Lord, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Lord as you used in previous passages.

Paul asks Timothy to be ready to suffer for the **gospel** as Paul suffers. Gospel means "good news." The good news in the Bible is that God has made a way to save people.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **gospel**. Look up gospel in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

God calls or chooses believers to live **holy** lives. Any place, person, or object that is dedicated to God is called holy. That means that the object or person is set apart for God's special purposes. When people begin to trust in Jesus and receive the Holy Spirit, those people become holy as well. The Holy Spirit works in a believer's heart to change that believer to become more and more like Jesus, to make them more and more holy or set apart for God's special purposes.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **holy**. Look up holy in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

God saves people because of God's **grace**. When someone shows us grace, that person does something good for us, or they give us something good that we do not deserve. God shows grace to people because God loves those people. God forgives those people for their sins and makes them God's children, even though people do not deserve it. For more information on grace, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for grace as you used in previous passages.

God gives people his grace through our **Savior**, Christ Jesus. A Savior is someone who rescues people from a difficult or dangerous situation. God saved people when God sent his son Jesus into the world.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **savior**. Look up savior in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

**Christ** is a title for Jesus that reminds the believers that Jesus is the Messiah, or the savior and king that God chose to come and rescue people. For more information on Christ, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Christ as you used in previous passages.

Paul reveals how people can have **immortality**, or **eternal life**, forever with God. Eternal life will never end. Eternal life is the gift that God gives to God's children if they believe in God. It begins now for believers, and it changes us and makes it possible for us to live in a close relationship with God.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **eternal life**. Look up eternal life in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Jesus **appointed** Paul to be a herald, apostle, and teacher. To appoint means to assign a job or role to someone and give that person authority to act in a certain way.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **appointed**. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

A **herald** or preacher is a person whom a king or some other important leader has sent to tell a message publicly.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will describe Paul as a preacher or herald. Pause this audio here.

An **apostle** is someone who received special authority from Jesus to speak on Jesus' behalf. Apostles tell people that Jesus really rose from the dead, they preach the gospel to all people, and they have authority in the church. For more information on apostle, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for apostle as you used in previous passages.

Paul urges Timothy to continue to have **faith** in Jesus. To have faith means to rely on someone, to trust and believe that what that person says is true. This specific faith is the way people believe in Jesus. That person believes that Jesus is the son of God and trusts that Jesus has died for their sins and that God has forgiven and accepted them. For more information on faith, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for faith as you used in previous passages.

Paul talks about how God will guard the gospel message until **that day**. This refers to the final day when Jesus will come back to earth to reward and judge people.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will describe the idea of "that day." If you have already translated this idea in another book of the Bible, use similar words or phrases that you have used there.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 1:15–18 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

You remember how Paul told Timothy not to be ashamed of the message about Christ, nor to be ashamed of Paul, who was in prison. In this passage, Paul gives Timothy examples of how different people have reacted to Paul being in prison. Paul first describes people who had become ashamed of Paul, particularly Phygelus and Hermogenes. Paul then describes a strong believer who had not been ashamed of Paul, Onesiphorus.

Paul gives the bad example first. Paul says that everyone in Asia had abandoned Paul, including Phygelus and Hermogenes. At that time, Asia was a large province of the Roman Empire. Asia was located in the western part of the modern country of Turkey. The most important city in the province of Asia was Ephesus. As you remember, Paul had worked for a long time to build up the church in Ephesus.

Paul says that all these people in Asia had turned away from Paul. Perhaps these people had turned away from the Christian message. Certainly, these people turned away from Paul. These people probably deserted Paul because Paul had been arrested and had become a public criminal, and these people were afraid or ashamed to be connected with Paul anymore. Phygelus and Hermogenes were part of this group of Asians who separated themselves from Paul. Timothy knew who Phygelus and Hermogenes were, but we do not. When Phygelus and Hermogenes chose to separate themselves from Paul, it must have hurt Paul very much. Paul says "all who are in Asia" deserted Paul. Paul is expressing strong feelings here. Paul may be exaggerating. We know that Timothy and Onesiphorus, for example, did not desert Paul.

Stop here and discuss as a group a time when someone close to you deserted you or failed you when you were at a moment of need. Do not share if the memory is too painful or inappropriate to mention to the group. Pause this audio here.

Paul does not want Timothy to desert Paul like Phygelus and Hermogenes did. Now, Paul gives Timothy a positive example through Onesiphorus. Paul is so grateful for Onesiphorus that Paul prays a blessing over Onesiphorus twice. Paul starts with a short prayer for mercy to Onesiphorus' household. The idea seems to be, "May God have mercy on Onesiphorus' household in the same way that Onesiphorus had mercy on me." Paul is asking God to show kindness and compassion to Onesiphorus' household in the same way Onesiphorus had compassion on Paul. Onesiphorus "refreshed" Paul many times. Onesiphorus certainly visited Paul in prison, and perhaps Onesiphorus provided food or other things Paul needed. In Roman culture, the friends and family of prisoners were often responsible to provide food and other necessary things for a prisoner like Paul.

Stop here and discuss as a group how prisoners receive their food in your country. Pause this audio here.

Next, Paul praises Onesiphorus for not being ashamed of Paul's chains. This is exactly what Paul asked Timothy to do earlier in this letter—to not be ashamed of Paul, who was in prison. Although Phygelus and Hermogenes had been ashamed of Paul, Onesiphorus was willing to be identified with Paul in prison, even though it might be dangerous for Onesiphorus. Onesiphorus realized that Paul was chained and in prison because Paul was proclaiming Jesus Christ faithfully. Onesiphorus realized that there is always a risk when we stand up publicly for Jesus.

Stop here and discuss the ways that non\-Christians may pressure or persecute Christian believers in your culture and country. Pause this audio here.

An excellent example of what Onesiphorus did for Paul is that when Onesiphorus arrived in Rome, Onesiphorus searched for Paul very carefully until he found Paul. Rome is the capital of the entire Roman Empire and the most important city of Paul's day. At the end of the book of Acts, Paul was under house arrest in Rome, so it would have been easy to find Paul then. But since it was hard for Onesiphorus to find Paul, most teachers think Paul writes 2 Timothy after the events in Acts and that Paul is now in a separate prison.

Stop here and look at a map that shows where Rome is in the present\-day country of Italy. Note how far this is from Ephesus, where Onesiphorus had come from and where Timothy was. Pause this audio here.

As Paul thinks of how bravely Onesiphorus served Paul with love, Paul again is moved to pray a blessing over Onesiphorus. Just as Onesiphorus had mercy and found Paul, may Onesiphorus find mercy from Jesus on the great final day of judgment. In the previous passage, Paul used the same expression "that Day" to refer to the day at the end of history when Jesus returns to judge all people. We all will need mercy from Jesus on that day. Paul knows Jesus' teaching that those who are merciful are blessed because they will find mercy from God on the last day. And so Paul seems to have confidence that Jesus, who is merciful, will give mercy to Onesiphorus, who is also merciful.

Paul reminds Timothy of all the service, or hard work, that Onesiphorus did in Ephesus. We are not exactly sure what this service was, but clearly Onesiphorus had been active in serving Paul and the Christian congregation for a long time before Onesiphorus came to Rome and helped Paul there. Although we can only guess the details, Timothy knew very well the many ways and times that Onesiphorus had served the Christian community in Ephesus.

Stop here and discuss the many ways individual Christians can serve the cause of Jesus and the church in your village or city. What types of service have other people done for you and for your church? Pause this audio here.

In this passage, Paul has provided Timothy with a negative and a positive example of what it means to "not be ashamed of Paul and his chains." Phygelus and Hermogenes have failed and have separated themselves from the imprisoned Apostle Paul. But Onesiphorus has bravely followed the Lord and identified himself with Paul while Paul was in a Roman prison.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 1:15–18 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the scenes, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has two scenes.

**In the first scene:** Paul gives a negative example that Timothy should avoid. Phygelus, Hermogenes, and many other people in Ephesus and the province of Asia have become ashamed of Paul and turned away from Paul.

**In the second scene:** Paul gives a positive example that Timothy should follow. Onesiphorus has not been ashamed of Paul but has come to Paul and helped Paul. Paul lists the good things Onesiphorus has done, and Paul prays a blessing on Onesiphorus and Onesiphorus' household.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy, who is listening to these words
* Phygelus and Hermogenes
* The other people in Asia who have turned away from Paul
* Onesiphorus
* And the Lord, probably Christ Jesus

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

As you visualize the first scene, picture Paul and all those who have turned away from Paul, including Phygelus, Hermogenes, and many others. Imagine who Phygelus and Hermogenes might have been: These men were probably church leaders, and perhaps these men were close friends of Paul. The closer these men were to Paul, the more painful it must have been to Paul when these men abandoned Paul.

Stop here and discuss who Phygelus and Hermogenes might have been. Pause this audio here.

We are not sure exactly what happened when all these church members from Asia turned away from Paul, but we can imagine. Did the church members turn away from the Christian faith too? Did the church members disappear when people arrested Paul, like Jesus' disciples did when people arrested Jesus? How did these church members fail Paul?

Stop here and discuss these questions: How did these church members from Asia desert Paul? Pause this audio here.

As you visualize the second scene, think about how Onesiphorus' entire household may have supported Paul. We are not sure, but had Paul stayed at their home? Had the family made financial contributions for Paul's ministry? Was the family supporting their father Onesiphorus as he went to Rome? Did Onesiphorus go to Rome for business reasons or specifically to help Paul?

Stop here and discuss these questions. Pause this audio here.

We are not sure what kind of place Paul was imprisoned in. But what do you imagine was the kind of place in which Paul was imprisoned if it took Onesiphorus a hard, and perhaps long, search to find Paul? What would it be like for Paul to be imprisoned there?

Unlike Phygelus and Hermogenes, Onesiphorus was not ashamed of Paul's chains. Sometimes Paul uses the expression of being in chains in a general way to talk about being in prison. In this case, the authorities have literally bound Paul in chains. Some Christians were afraid to associate with Paul since Paul was chained as a criminal. But not Onesiphorus, who loved Paul and Paul's message about Christ!

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will describe chains to show that Paul is literally tied in chains in prison as a criminal. Pause this audio here.

Paul uses the idea of finding something twice near the end of our passage. Paul does this with a purpose, to emphasize something. Paul says in effect, Onesiphorus showed mercy and found me—may the Lord allow Onesiphorus to find mercy from the Lord on that day. Most likely, Paul is talking about the Lord Jesus, who is merciful and who will judge all people when he comes back to earth. Paul seems to be affirming this: just as Onesiphorus had mercy and found Paul in prison, may Onesiphorus find mercy from Jesus on the great final day when Jesus comes to judge.

The fact that Paul prays another prayer for blessing on Onesiphorus shows how grateful Paul is for what Onesiphorus did. Our passage ends with Paul reminding Timothy just how many things Onesiphorus had done for Paul and the Christian community in Ephesus in earlier days. We are not sure, but what kinds of things do you think Onesiphorus might have done to make Paul talk about "all the service he rendered"?

Stop here and discuss the many ways Onesiphorus may have helped the apostle Paul as he lived and ministered in the city of Ephesus. How will you show that Paul was grateful in Paul's prayer? Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. As you do this, you might want to have drawings or objects to represent Paul, Phygelus and Hermogenes, the Asians who rejected Paul, and of course Onesiphorus as characters in the story. Think of how you want to include Timothy, the listener, in your presentation of these two scenes.

In the first scene, Paul gives a negative example that Timothy should avoid. And in the second scene, Paul gives a positive example that Timothy should follow, and Paul speaks a double blessing over Onesiphorus. Onesiphorus is an example for Timothy of how a person should respond to Paul, even when Paul had been arrested by the government for preaching about Jesus Christ.

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 1:15–18 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has two scenes.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy, who is listening to these words
* Phygelus and Hermogenes
* The other people in Asia who have turned away from Paul
* Onesiphorus
* And the Lord, probably Christ Jesus

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing a character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following are some examples that might be used in the drama and possible responses.

In the first scene, act out how Phygelus, Hermogenes, and many others in the province of Asia have deserted Paul.

Pause the drama.

Then ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel very hurt, unsupported, or betrayed. I am concerned about the health of the congregation in Ephesus. This is because so many people, even leaders I trusted, have become ashamed of me and of the gospel message about Christ.

You might consider breaking the second scene into two parts. First, you could show Onesiphorus searching all over Rome for Paul's prison and then finally finding Paul and refreshing Paul with food and other kinds of encouragement.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking now?" The person might answer things like:

* I am so thankful to God and to Onesiphorus for visiting me. So I pray to Lord Jesus that Jesus would bless Onesiphorus' entire family.

Second, you might show short scenes of some of the ways Onesiphorus had served Paul and the congregation in Ephesus.

Pause the drama.

You could ask the person playing Onesiphorus, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I love my Savior, Jesus, and I want to do anything I possibly can for Jesus' people; or
* I love the Apostle Paul, since Paul led me to Jesus Christ, who gives me eternal life. I would do anything I could out of love for Paul and the gospel.

You could ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" This person might answer things like:

* I am so grateful for all the mercy Onesiphorus has shown me and all the Christians in Ephesus. So I pray to God that God would show Onesiphorus mercy when Jesus examines and rewards us all for faithful service on the last day.

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 1:15–18 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Twice in this passage, Paul prays that God will grant or give **mercy** to Onesiphorus and to Onesiphorus' household. When someone shows mercy to someone, they show kindness or concern for someone in serious need. These are prayers that God would have pity or compassion on Onesiphorus and Onesiphorus' family whenever they have a need. Translate mercy in the same way as you have in previous passages, and see the Master Glossary for mercy if you need more information.

Paul asks that the **Lord** would show Onesiphorus mercy on **that day**. Lord here probably refers to Christ but may refer to God the Father. That day refers to the final day when Jesus comes back to earth to reward and judge people. Use the same words for Lord and for "that day" as you have in previous passages, and see the Master Glossary for further information about Lord.

When Paul prays a blessing on the **household** of Onesiphorus, Paul is thinking not just of Onesiphorus, but also of Onesiphorus' wife and children. "Household" in Roman days referred to the extended family, which included slaves who lived with the family. See the Master Glossary for more information on household. Onesiphorus is the head of this family, and it seems that Onesiphorus had enough money to be able to travel to Rome and to really help Paul in his needs.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **household**.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 2:1–7 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In the last passage, Paul gave Timothy positive and negative examples of what it meant to not be ashamed of the gospel or of Paul, the apostle who brings the gospel. In this passage, Paul is preparing Paul's helper Timothy to get ready for the difficult things that Paul wants Timothy to do. To help Timothy understand how Timothy should act, Paul compares their work for Christ to a few other kinds of people who work hard for a specific goal.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, when a young person is about to face a difficult and important task, who helps prepare the young person for that task? How does that person encourage or warn the young person? What else does that person do to help prepare the young person? Pause this audio here.

First, Paul reminds Timothy of his need for grace. Paul calls Timothy to receive strength from the grace, or undeserved favor, that comes from Christ Jesus. God's grace is the only source of power for a Christian's life and service.

Then Paul tells Timothy to pass on what Timothy has learned from Paul. Paul wants Timothy to teach Paul's message to trustworthy people who can also teach others. There must be dependable leaders who will not change or forget what Timothy taught and who will care for the congregation in Ephesus. Timothy will be leaving the city soon to go to Rome. And we have just read that many people have turned away from Paul throughout the province of Asia. The Ephesians need leaders, so first, they need someone to teach believers how to lead and be faithful.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do leaders in your churches train others to become teachers? How do you select people who become teachers in the churches? What do these people do to show that they are reliable and trustworthy to lead in the church? Pause this audio here.

Next, Paul returns to Paul's most important theme of suffering. Earlier, Paul had called Timothy to share in suffering for the gospel with the strength God gives Timothy. Here again, Paul calls his disciple Timothy to share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. Just as the good soldier is willing to suffer for his cause, Paul is teaching Timothy that all faithful service involves suffering.

Paul then goes on to use three examples of people who are devoted to their duty: the soldier, the athlete, and the farmer. Each of these people is completely committed to their task. Each of these people works hard to reach their goal. These people do not let anything distract them from finishing their job. These people keep going even when things are difficult because they believe their goal is more important than any difficult thing they face.

The soldier does not focus on everyday matters. The soldier does whatever it takes to please the officer who is in command of him. In our case, this applies to Jesus, our commander. The athlete only gets the prize by competing according to the rules. Here, Paul again emphasizes how Timothy must work hard in everything Timothy does. Timothy must never give up or stop.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, in addition to soldiers, athletes, and farmers, who are some other people who are very disciplined and devoted to their work? What kinds of things do these people do to show that they are devoted to their work? Pause this audio here.

Finally, Paul mentions the farmer. Paul seems to emphasize two things. First, Timothy should work as hard as a devoted farmer. And second, just as the farmer gets a reward for his work, Timothy can expect a reward for his labors when Timothy serves Christ. It is proper to pay pastors for their labors, but Paul does not seem to be teaching that idea here. Paul seems to be talking about the honors that Timothy will receive on the day that Christ returns to judge all people.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Who are some people in your culture who work hard and have great difficulty, but who other people honor in the end? How is this an example and an encouragement to us as Christians when we work to serve the church? When God promises us a reward for our work and dedication to God, how does that encourage you to serve even more? Pause this audio here.

Paul concludes this passage by calling Timothy to think carefully about these things and assuring Timothy that the Lord will cause Timothy to understand. These examples and the letter as a whole will be important and useful to all of Timothy's life and ministry. Timothy should carefully pray and think about these teachings.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 2:1–7 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has four parts.

**In the first part:** Paul urges Timothy to continually find the strength that comes from the grace that God gives us when God sent Christ.

**In the second part:** Paul commands Timothy to train faithful people who show themselves able to teach others the Christian message.

**In the third part:** Paul calls Timothy to endure suffering for a good cause, like a soldier, an athlete, and a farmer.

**In the fourth part:** Paul urges Timothy to think on Paul's words and to discover how to apply those words since God will give Timothy understanding.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul the speaker
* Timothy the listener
* Christ Jesus, who plays three roles as the source of grace, the commanding officer, and the one who gives understanding
* The many witnesses who heard Paul speak to Timothy about the gospel, probably in a formal setting
* The faithful people who will teach others the Christian message
* The people who learn the Christian message from those faithful people
* A soldier
* An athlete
* And a farmer

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In the first part, Paul calls Timothy "my child," as Paul called Timothy "my beloved child" at the beginning of the letter. Paul says this to show Paul's close relationship with Timothy and Paul's authority over Timothy, like a father has over his son.

Stop here and discuss how you will show this close relationship between Paul and Timothy. How will you show Paul's fatherly authority? Pause this audio here.

Think about how strange and wonderful it is that all our power for living the Christian life comes from outside ourselves. As Paul says in another place, it is when Paul is weak that Paul is strong. We must realize that we have no strength in ourselves and that all our strength for Christian service comes from Jesus himself.

Stop here and discuss: How can you visualize how all Timothy's strength comes to Timothy from Christ Jesus? How can you visualize how that same strength comes to us as believers by grace, because Jesus gives us kindness even when we do not deserve it? How might you show or draw this idea? Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul refers to a time when Paul spoke to Timothy in a public setting with witnesses. It is possible that at least one of those public settings was when Timothy's church appointed or chose Timothy as a church leader. Now, Timothy should share what Timothy heard at that and other important meetings with other reliable men. Just like Paul prepared Timothy to be a leader, Timothy should teach those reliable men to be leaders as well. Then those new leaders can go teach other people.

Stop here and discuss how you appoint and give authority to teachers or pastors in your churches. Can you visualize a scene where Paul is commanding Timothy to train up other leaders who will teach the gospel faithfully in the church? Discuss how you will talk about reliable and trustworthy men. Pause this audio here.

In the third part, Paul calls Timothy to be a faithful minister of the gospel. Paul uses three examples to emphasize how Timothy must suffer and endure to do his duty. A good soldier is not only willing to suffer, but is also not distracted by unimportant things. A good soldier is prepared for war and is completely focused on his military responsibilities. That soldier will not allow civilian, or non\-military, matters to distract him. That soldier's one desire is to please his commanding officer. In this case, Timothy is like that soldier, and Timothy's commanding officer is Christ Jesus himself.

Stop here and discuss how a soldier might be tempted to lose his focus on pleasing his commanding officer. Other things in this world could distract that soldier from becoming an excellent warrior. What things have you seen a soldier do instead of focusing on how he or she can become a good soldier? How will you talk about how good soldiers do not get distracted by other things? Pause this audio here.

The next example Paul uses to encourage Timothy is that of a devoted athlete. Such a person must be very determined and committed. The athlete must choose to train beforehand, even when it hurts or exhausts them. The athlete must also choose to follow strict rules during the competitions. The last example Paul uses for Timothy is of a hard\-working farmer. Like a farmer, Timothy must work for a long time and be patient in his work. In both the case of the athlete and the farmer, Paul mentions the reward for their labors. An athlete competes for the prize of a crown. In Paul's day, people made an athlete's crown from leaves. The farmer works for a large share of the harvest.

Stop here and discuss as a group: In your language, how would you describe soldiers, farmers, and athletes, especially ones who are very dedicated and committed to their jobs? Discuss how you will compare these people's attitudes and actions with how Paul wants Timothy to act. Pause this audio here.

Stop here and look at a photo of an athlete's crown together as a group. Pause this audio here.

In the fourth part, Paul tells Timothy to take time to think about everything Paul is saying. There are many ways that Timothy can follow what Paul teaches here and in this entire letter. Paul wants Timothy to seriously consider what difference Paul's words should make in Timothy's life and in the life of the church in Ephesus. As we learn from Proverbs, the Lord is the one who gives people understanding and wisdom. Paul is sure that the Lord will do this for Timothy. Though perhaps Lord refers to God the Father, "the Lord" here probably refers to Christ.

Stop here and discuss as a group: How would you encourage someone to think about what you have just told that person? How will you translate this last encouragement to Timothy? Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has four parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul the speaker
* Timothy the listener
* Christ Jesus, who plays three roles as the source of grace, the commanding officer, and the one who gives understanding
* The many witnesses who heard Paul speak to Timothy about the gospel, evidently in a formal setting
* The faithful people who will teach others the Christian message
* The people who learn the Christian message from these faithful people
* A soldier
* An athlete
* And a farmer

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

In the first part, as you act out Paul's command to Timothy, notice how Paul calls Timothy "my child," as Paul did at the beginning of the letter. Paul calls Timothy to find all Timothy's strength in Christ, who gives us abilities by grace.

Pause the drama.

Then ask the person playing Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel very weak and unable to be brave or carry out my work as a minister; or
* When I feel weak, I remember that Paul himself felt this way. Paul said, "When I am weak, then I am strong." Christ's strength goes only to those who feel like they need it!

In the second part, Paul reminds Timothy that Paul has taught the message about Christ to Timothy in front of many witnesses. Timothy should also teach that message to reliable and faithful people, just like Paul did. Those reliable and faithful people can then teach other people as well.

Pause the drama.

Then ask the person playing Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel overwhelmed by how big and difficult this task is.

In the third part, you may want to break the action into three parts as Paul compares how Timothy should act with three different kinds of people. First, you can show a good soldier who is trying above all else to please his commanding officer.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing the soldier, "What are you feeling or thinking now?" The person might answer things like:

* I am trying not to be distracted by anything else so that I can focus on winning my commander's approval.

Secondly, you can show an athlete who is so committed to winning that the athlete does many painful things to prepare his body well for the competition ahead. And thirdly, you can show a farmer working very hard with his crops so that the farmer will have a large harvest of food.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing the farmer, "What are you feeling or thinking now?" The person might answer things like:

* I am really looking forward to having all this grain in my barn. I will have enough food for my family all winter.

In the fourth part, Paul again speaks to Timothy like a son. Paul tells Timothy to listen carefully and think closely about what Paul has been saying. You may have Paul point upward towards the Lord Christ when Paul says that the Lord will give Timothy understanding in everything.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking now?" The person might answer things like:

* I am encouraged that the Lord will indeed help me and truly make me understand what I should do.

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 2:1–7 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

The Apostle Paul gives three commands to Timothy in this passage. The first is that Timothy should "**be strong** by the grace that is in Christ Jesus." "Be strong" is tied to what Paul said earlier, that God gave us a spirit of **strength**, or power. Timothy must receive the power that Timothy needs from Christ by the Spirit and as a grace or gift. You may remember that Paul earlier talked about the gift of God that Timothy received when Paul laid hands on Timothy. The word gift is related to the idea of grace in our passage. Use the same word for grace as you have used in previous passages. For more information on grace, refer to the Master Glossary. All strength for Christian life and service comes as a gift from the Lord Jesus.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will describe how Paul says to "be strong, or be strengthened, by the grace that is in Christ Jesus." Pause this audio here.

**Christ** means Messiah. The Messiah is the promised king and savior of the world, whom God chose. For more information on Christ, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Christ as you used in previous passages.

The second command Paul gives Timothy is, "**Share with me in suffering**." This can also be translated as "Join with me in suffering" or "endure your part in suffering." You will remember that earlier, Paul called Timothy to "share in suffering for the gospel by the power of God."

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for "share with me in suffering." Pause this audio here.

Paul uses three illustrations to emphasize how Timothy must be disciplined, focused, and completely devoted to the work of Christian service that Paul calls Timothy to do. The first example is of a good soldier. Such a person must not get "entangled in **civilian pursuits**." This does not mean a pastor can never be a businessman or have other work or income from sources other than the congregation. Paul's teaching example here simply shows how a great soldier must not be distracted from his military training and service by buying, selling, or the other normal events of this life. A soldier must be completely devoted to pleasing his supervising officer. Similarly, we should be completely devoted to Christ and pleasing Christ.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for "civilian pursuits." Pause this audio here.

Paul also describes athletes who compete for a **crown**. A crown is a headdress or a round ornament that people wear on their heads. People made athletes' crowns out of leaves.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **crown**. Look at the picture of the crown again as needed. Pause this audio here.

All three examples that Paul uses emphasize how Timothy must be fully determined to serve Jesus and be very patient and self\-controlled as Timothy faces the difficulties that will come his way. The third example is a hard\-working farmer. Paul says that the farmer should receive the **first share** of the crops. Here, Paul is not talking about how pastors should be paid. Neither is Paul saying that Timothy will be the first to receive honors from Christ on the last day. Paul seems to be showing how certain it is that Timothy will receive a reward. If Timothy is faithful to teach the gospel, Christ will reward Timothy for his service on the last day. This should give Timothy encouragement and energy to work hard and to go through suffering.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use to show how the farmer ought to have the "first share" of the crops. Pause this audio here.

The third and last command that Paul gives Timothy is that Timothy should "think over" or consider what Paul is saying. Paul has given Timothy important principles, but Timothy needs wisdom to apply those principles to the situations in his life and work. Paul encourages Timothy by saying, "because the Lord will give you **understanding** in everything." Understanding refers to the insight and wisdom that we need to take the teaching of the Bible and connect it to the details and daily decisions of our lives.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use to translate the understanding, insight, or wisdom from God that Paul talks about here. Pause this audio here.

A **lord** is someone who is a master over other people. A lord has full authority and deserves respect from people. Jesus is Lord, because Jesus has authority over the whole world. For more information on Lord, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Lord as you used in previous passages.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 2:8–13 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

Until now, in the letter, Paul has encouraged Timothy to continue to share the good news about Jesus with boldness. Paul gave examples of specific people who suffer and endure to finish a specific goal: a soldier, an athlete, and a farmer. Paul now uses himself as an example and asks Timothy to suffer and endure like Paul himself does. Paul is doing what Jesus did, and Paul wants Timothy to do the same. Paul reminds Timothy to depend more and more on Jesus by remembering that Jesus is a descendant of David, and that God raised Jesus from the dead. Remember that the Jewish people were waiting for God's promised Savior, the Christ. The Christ was supposed to be the descendant of the Jewish people's most famous king, King David. Paul asks Timothy to remember the very important truth that God raised Jesus from the dead and that Jesus is a descendant of David. This means Jesus is the Christ the Jews have been waiting for.

Paul is in prison and expects to be put to death soon. Paul is saying goodbye to Timothy and writing his last words to Timothy as a spiritual father. Paul's goal is to bless and encourage Paul's "beloved son," Timothy, with important instructions to guide Timothy for the rest of Timothy's life. This is a very personal letter that Paul writes to influence Timothy's thoughts and behaviors using examples from Paul's life.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do elders in your culture typically pass on encouragement to younger generations before they die? What are some different ways people give instruction to younger people? Pause this audio here.

Government officials bound Paul in chains in prison, but people can never bind God's message in chains. God's word, or message, is also always effective. Paul asks Timothy to remember Jesus, our resurrected Savior, because Jesus is the reason Paul is willing to suffer as a criminal. Paul is also willing to suffer for God's people. God's people are those whom God has chosen, or elected, to be in God's family. By loving God's people, Paul is imitating Jesus. The result is that God's chosen people get to live forever with Jesus in a perfect world.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What kinds of crimes do people go to prison for in your culture? How would people think about a Christian if the government put that Christian in prison? Tell a story about someone you know who was in prison or persecuted for their faith. Pause this audio here.

As Paul continues to encourage Timothy, Paul quotes a short song or poem to highlight why we can and should endure through suffering. Paul introduces Paul's song with, "This saying is trustworthy," which is a way Paul emphasizes important spiritual truths through traditional songs and sayings. Paul has probably adjusted a traditional song, but Timothy would have known the original song also. Through this song, Paul emphasizes the suffering that believers endure. The song gives us both strong warnings about denying the faith and also the eternal promises that come when we endure suffering. In the song, Paul explains that when we die with Christ, we will get new life. Paul means that if we stop living like someone who sins and does not know Christ, it is like we are dying to the person we used to be. But if we stop living like that old person, we will actually get a new life with Christ! Paul also explains that if we endure in trusting Jesus, we will rule with Jesus when Jesus comes to fully rule his kingdom. However, Paul warns us that if we deny or disown Christ when we are suffering, Christ will also deny that he knows us. But Paul also reminds us that because Jesus is faithful, we can be confident in Jesus when we fail, knowing that we still live with sin in our lives. Paul can endure because Paul trusts Jesus. Paul wants Timothy to understand how dangerous it is to walk away from Jesus. However, Paul also wants Timothy to be encouraged by how faithful Jesus is and the rewards that come from following Jesus.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What kinds of things help you to be loyal to someone when it is difficult?

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 2:8–13 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has two parts.

**In the first part:** Paul instructs Timothy to suffer and endure for the sake of Christ's gospel, which provides power and hope, so that God may save God's chosen people from eternal suffering and instead give those people eternal glory.

**In the second part:** Paul gives a trustworthy saying that further encourages Timothy. Paul encourages Timothy to accept the promises of the gospel by enduring suffering as a servant of God. Paul also gives a serious warning that we should never deny or disown Jesus.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* Jesus, the Christ
* And God's chosen people

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In the first part, Paul tells Timothy to "remember." Paul is asking Timothy to think back to what Timothy already knows about who Jesus is. Timothy has learned about faith in Jesus from his family and also from Paul. Paul reminds Timothy that Jesus is the Christ, the promised Savior, who rose from the dead and who is the descendant of King David, the most famous Jewish king. Paul also encourages Timothy to remember Jesus as "raised from the dead," because Paul believes that one of the most important parts of the good news is that believers will rise from the dead one day, even after they die. Paul wants Timothy to understand that suffering is part of following the risen Christ until Christ returns. The good news, or gospel, is that Jesus is the king and Savior that the Jewish people had been waiting for. Paul is not only reminding Timothy about the gospel message, but also how Paul is suffering in the same way that Jesus suffered. Paul wants Timothy to not just know the message but also to do what Jesus says to do! Paul explains that Paul is bound and suffering as a criminal because of Paul's dedication to preach the gospel. But Paul also says that Paul's imprisonment cannot stop the power of God's word, which is the gospel. People thought Paul's chains were supposed to stop what God is doing through Paul, but instead, it only proves how strong Paul's message is. This is so important to Paul that Paul is willing to endure anything for the good of God's elect, God's chosen people. Paul deeply desires that the people God chooses will receive salvation and that Jesus will save those people and bring them into a good relationship with God. And with that salvation, Jesus will make those people perfect and welcome them into his perfect, glory\-filled kingdom forever when Jesus returns.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about when someone you know gave an example from their own life to teach you what to do in a certain situation. Pay attention to how you use examples from your own life in this story. Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul sends a poem with a message that Paul wants Timothy to know he can trust. The familiar format of the poem helps readers know that they should pay attention. To make this clear, Paul introduces the poem with the phrase: "This saying is trustworthy." Paul also uses this phrase at other times to communicate the authority of what Paul is saying as opposed to the false teaching Paul is opposing.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do you communicate that what someone is saying is true in your language? Are there different ways to make this clear? Pause this audio here.

The poem then refers back with more detail to what Paul wants Timothy to remember. Paul wants Timothy to remember Jesus and how we must suffer if we follow Jesus. Paul makes a series of statements that explain what it looks like to follow Jesus and the rewards Jesus promises to us if we follow Jesus. Paul also warns us how Jesus responds when we fail to follow Jesus. In each of Paul's statements, Paul talks about if someone does a certain thing, then a certain thing happens as a result. This way of speaking helps Paul make a point that is easy to remember and hard to disagree with.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: When you are trying to convince someone of something important, how do you make a strong argument for something you know is true? Pause this audio here.

The first section of the poem reminds Timothy that if we have died with Jesus, we have a new life and will also live with Jesus in eternity. Dying with Christ does not mean that we have to physically die when we follow Jesus. Dying with Christ may refer to baptism, because baptism shows that a believer stops living their old life and lives a new life following Jesus. For Paul, this promise that believers will rise from the dead is one of the most important things we believe when we follow Jesus.

The next section reminds Timothy that enduring suffering, or continuing to follow Jesus, is necessary to receive the promise of ruling with Jesus in God's kingdom forever. Here, Paul reminds Timothy again that Timothy must do something in order to follow Jesus. Paul points Timothy back to Paul's own suffering and endurance for Jesus as a model. Again, Paul is telling Timothy to imitate Paul in this way. Paul wants Timothy to see that enduring suffering is what followers of Jesus should expect. Paul makes it clear that this endurance results in the incredible reward of ruling with Jesus in his kingdom when Jesus returns to the earth.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do you emphasize to someone that you want that person to imitate you, or do what you do? Pause this audio here.

Now, the next section introduces a strong warning. Paul is saying here that if we have not died with Jesus and do not endure suffering, this means we have walked away from Jesus. Paul tells Timothy that if we deny that we know Jesus when we suffer, Jesus will deny that Jesus knows us.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do you give strong warnings in your language? Pause this audio here.

Paul tells Timothy something surprising in the last section of the poem. In the first three sections of this poem, God promises that we will receive good things if we do good things, and we will receive bad things if we do bad things. But here Paul tells Timothy that if we are faithless, Jesus will still be faithful to us. We may sometimes fail to do what is right, but Jesus helps us to endure. To be faithless is different from walking away from Jesus or denying Jesus. Followers of Jesus are not perfect yet, and that means sometimes we will fail to be faithful, which means to fail to do what God has asked us to do. We grow closer to Jesus when we tell Jesus about our sin and ask Jesus to forgive us and change us. Paul is encouraging Timothy to remember that Jesus will always be faithful to Timothy. Jesus will be faithful even when Timothy makes mistakes doing the work God has called Timothy to do. And to prove this promise is true, Paul explains that it is impossible for Jesus to deny himself. In other words, Jesus has to be faithful to his people because it is who Jesus is and what Jesus does, and Jesus cannot be someone else. Jesus is God, and there is no other God.

Pause here and discuss as a group: How will you talk about how Jesus cannot disown or deny himself in your translation? Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

Embodying the Text
------------------

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 2:8–13 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has two parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* Jesus, the Christ
* And God's chosen people

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "Timothy, remember the good news of Jesus Christ, who is risen from the dead and the descendant of King David. I am suffering in prison right now, bound with chains as a criminal for this good news. But God's word, which is the gospel, is not bound!"

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am glad that Paul is reminding me of what is really true. I am sad my friend is in prison and being treated harshly, but he is hopeful despite his suffering, and that gives me hope; or
* I know that the gospel is good news, but I am having a hard time believing that when everything is so hard. My best friend is in prison! I am glad he is encouraging me, but I feel like I should be encouraging him; or
* I had forgotten the reasons we have for knowing for certain that Jesus is the Christ. As I think about my friend suffering as a criminal, I remember how the same thing happened to Jesus. Knowing Paul and the suffering he is going through helps me understand better what Jesus did for me. I feel unworthy of the love Jesus has shown to save me.

Paul says, "Because God's word is free and powerful, I can endure everything. I also do this because I want Jesus to save God's chosen people, his elect, so they can live with him and share his glory forever."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing God's chosen people, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* Paul must really love Jesus and us! Paul wants us to have something so good that he is willing to suffer anything. Only Jesus could make someone love like that; or
* I am not sure I love like Paul loves. I love Jesus, but I am afraid to go to jail. Paul's love is a little scary. It makes me realize that there is a cost to following Jesus. It is a high cost, but it is worth it; or
* To be God's chosen people is a privilege I do not deserve. But it makes me want to endure when I think about what Jesus has done to make me his own and what he has promised me.

Paul says, "Timothy, I am going to tell you something in a familiar way that you can trust. If we die with Jesus, we also live with Jesus. If we endure, we get to reign with Jesus. Now, be aware that if we disown Jesus, Jesus will disown us. But when we stumble in our faith, Jesus will always remain faithful because Jesus cannot deny that he is who he is—Jesus is God."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Jesus, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I want all people to live and reign with me forever, and for this reason, I have died to defeat death. Now, anyone can have this life, but they must come to me; or
* I love Paul! Paul speaks what is true. And because I love Paul, and Paul believes it, Paul is able to endure. My power rests on Paul in Paul's weakness; or
* I am who I am, and I must be faithful to that. I do not want anyone to go to hell, but because I love people, I want people to know the truth if they walk away from me.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I really want Timothy to understand how important this is. I love Timothy so much! I really see Timothy as my son. I know Timothy can be timid, but I know that Jesus can help Timothy to stand strong to serve Jesus; or
* I know I am going to die soon. I want Timothy to continue where I have ended. I want Timothy to have the same passion I have for God's people and know that Jesus will be faithful to Timothy and the people even if Timothy fails. But Timothy must endure; or
* I am completely confident that Jesus will accomplish what Jesus has begun in Timothy, but Timothy needs to know that, too. I hope Timothy will remember this saying when Timothy is struggling to serve people well and I am not around.

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 2:8–13 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul tells Timothy to remember Jesus **Christ**. Use the same word or phrase for Christ as you used in previous passages. For more information on Christ, refer to the Master Glossary.

Paul says that Jesus, who is the Christ, is what Paul preaches in his **gospel**, or **good news**. Use the same word or phrase for gospel or good news as you used in previous passages. For more information on gospel, refer to the Master Glossary.

Paul says that God's **Word** is not in chains, like Paul is. God's Word is God's message about Jesus. Paul and other people preach and teach God's message.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for "God's Word." Refer to word in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this idea in another book of the Bible, use the same word or phrase that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul says that believers will live with Jesus in eternal **glory**. In this case, believers will live with Jesus and see all of Jesus' power and majesty.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will say that believers live with Jesus in glory forever. Refer to glory in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this idea in another book of the Bible, use the same words or phrases that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul says that Paul endures everything for the sake of the **elect**. To elect something means to choose it. When Paul talks about the elect, Paul is talking about people God has chosen to be his people. And those people whom God chooses, God saves. God chooses people because God is gracious. God does not choose people because people deserve it. When God chooses someone, that person desires to do what God wants that person to do.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **elect**. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word or phrase that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul wants people to receive God's **salvation**. When God saves someone, God saves that person from the punishment for their sin. God saved us by sending God's son Jesus into the world. Anybody who trusts in Jesus will be saved. We all need God to save us. Another way to say this is that we all need salvation. God is the only one who can give people salvation. God saves people so that we no longer have to be afraid. We no longer have to be ashamed. We can now have a good relationship with God, and we can trust that even after we die, we will live forever with God.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **salvation**. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Refer to salvation in the Master Glossary for more information. Pause this audio here.

Paul says that Jesus remains **faithful** even when we are not faithful. When someone is faithful, it means you can believe that person will do what that person says they will do. That person is reliable. You can have faith in that person or believe in that person.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will say that sometimes we are not faithful, but Jesus is always faithful. In other words, we can trust Jesus even though sometimes we are not trustworthy ourselves. For more information about the idea of faith or belief, refer to faith in the Master Glossary.

Setting the Stage

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 2:14–19 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In the last section of his letter, Paul strongly encouraged Timothy to remember the good news of Jesus, the faithful King, who came to save us from sin and give us eternal life. With this hope in mind, Paul encourages Timothy to imitate Paul in suffering for the good news to help God's chosen people live with Jesus in heaven forever. In this section, we learn more about why Paul urges Timothy so strongly. There are some people in the church of Ephesus who are teaching things that are untrue about Jesus. Paul calls these people false teachers. Paul wants Timothy to understand how dangerous false teaching is and what to do about it.

Paul just asked Timothy to remember what the good news is all about, and now Paul tells Timothy to remind other people in the church. Paul also tells Timothy to specifically warn the believers not to have arguments about words with false teachers. This means not to fight about problems that the believers can never solve. The reason Paul gives this warning is that this kind of argument is dangerous and can ruin people's faith in the truth. This is how the false teachers try to deceive people. Paul wants Timothy to warn the church not to do what the false teachers do.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what do you think about people who argue and debate all the time, but never come to a conclusion? Discuss a time when you have argued or seen other people argue in this way. Have people ever argued like this in your church? How did arguing affect people? Pause this audio here.

Paul tells Timothy that Timothy must do Timothy's best to please God as a leader in the church. To do this, Timothy must act correctly and teach God's word correctly. Paul says doing this makes Timothy an "approved" worker. This means that God has "tested" Timothy and Timothy has passed the test. When Timothy understands that God approves of Timothy, Timothy can teach the "word of truth," the gospel, confidently and without shame. Paul explains that Timothy must handle God's word correctly. This is the opposite of the way the false teachers twist the truth and make it untrue.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do people expect leaders to behave and speak in your community? Have you ever had to be a leader in your community? How did it feel to try to lead people well in your community? Pause this audio here.

Paul now restates Paul's first warning about using words wrongly and the negative consequences this creates. Paul calls the talk of the false teachers "godless chatter." When people talk like this, people say a lot of foolish things that have nothing to do with God. This threatens to turn the teaching of the church into faulty human thinking instead of the "word of truth," which comes from God's wisdom. Paul also explains that this kind of talking makes the speakers and the hearers less and less like God. While truth makes people more like God, false teaching makes them less like God. Paul then compares this false teaching to gangrene, which could mean any disease that can spread and infect the whole body. Paul's concern is that the body of the church would get spiritually sick and die.

Paul now mentions two of the false teachers who did not teach and use God's word correctly, Hymenaeus and Philetus. You might remember that Paul already mentioned removing Hymenaeus from the church for false teaching in 1 Timothy. Paul explains specifically what the false teaching is that is hurting the faith of some people in the church. The wrong teaching is that the resurrection that God promises when Jesus comes again has already happened. We do not know exactly what Hymenaeus and Philetus taught, but this teaching seemed to create various wrong ideas. Many people think that Hymenaeus and Philetus taught that the resurrection was only spiritual and not physical. This would hurt the faith of some because it ruins the hope of being resurrected in perfection after death. This is the main false teaching that Timothy has to address in the Ephesian church.

Finally, Paul encourages Timothy and reminds Timothy that God's chosen church is a firm foundation and is unshakable despite enemy attacks. A foundation is a solid base that makes a building strong. Paul compares the church to a strong building that has God's "seal," or mark of authority, on it. The seal means God is the owner of the church and is in control of what happens to the church. It was common to include the building owner's name and a saying in the seal that builders put on a building's foundation. To emphasize God's care for God's church, Paul quotes from a story in the Old Testament. The story from the Old Testament reminds Timothy of how God has preserved God's people when some people challenged God's authority. These quotes from the story are what God writes on the "seal."

Stop here and look at a picture of a seal as a group. Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, how do you guarantee that you will protect someone or provide for that person? What kinds of things do you do or symbols do you use? Pause this audio here.

Paul's quotes are from the story about the rebellion of Korah in the book of Numbers. Korah was a man who led people to rebel against Moses and Aaron, God's appointed leaders. God caused the earth to swallow up Korah and Korah's followers as a consequence of their actions. This is a story that many of Paul's listeners would be familiar with. Paul tells this story to let Timothy know that challenging the authority of God now is just as dangerous. Paul says God knows who God's chosen people are, which means that God's church cannot be destroyed. However, the second quote emphasizes that those people who claim to be God's children must leave evil things behind them. The false teachers are challenging God's appointed and approved leaders. This is the same as what Korah and Korah's followers did. Paul makes it clear that Timothy must challenge this evil behavior.

Defining the Scenes

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 2:14–19 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul tells Timothy to remind people of the truth and warn people not to participate in foolish arguments that waste time.

**In the second part:** Paul focuses on the behavior and teaching of Timothy and contrasts it with that of the false teachers.

**In the third part:** Paul encourages Timothy that God is in control of preserving God's church, and Paul uses evidence from the Old Testament.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* People in the church
* And the false teachers, Hymenaeus and Philetus

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In the first part, Paul tells Timothy to continue to remind the people in the church about "these things." Paul is probably referring to either the things that Paul has already told Timothy in this letter or the things that Paul is about to say to Timothy. Paul tells Timothy to warn the people in the church not to argue meaninglessly with false teachers. Paul makes it clear that arguing like this only damages whoever participates.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do you warn someone in your language? How do you communicate that people need to take seriously what you say so that nothing bad will happen? Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul helps Timothy understand the difference between an "approved" worker and a false teacher. Paul urges Timothy to do Timothy's best in Timothy's work for God. Paul also tells Timothy to work with confidence as someone whom God approves. If Timothy works in this way, Timothy will not be ashamed. Timothy should work hard to teach the "word of truth" correctly without straying in any way from what that word teaches. Paul literally tells Timothy to "cut the 'word of truth' straight." This is very different from the false teachers who will be ashamed for twisting the truth. Paul warns Timothy again to stay away from the "godless chatter or talking" of the false teachers. This kind of talking makes people less like God and spreads like a disease that infects the whole church. Paul then names Hymenaeus and Philetus as examples of people becoming less like God. These two people have claimed that God has already raised people from the dead and perhaps even that Christ has already returned! These two men are attacking an important message of the gospel, and this attack is hurting people's faith, including Hymenaeus and Philetus' own faith.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Paul uses the image of a straight path and a crooked path to compare true and false teaching. Then Paul compares false teaching to a disease. How do you make contrasts between false and true teaching in your language? How will you translate this contrast in this passage? Pause this audio here.

In the third part, Paul encourages Timothy to remember that despite the danger of the false teachers, God's church, God's chosen people, is like a firm foundation of a house. In that time, people built houses on rocks to make the houses strong. Paul makes a strong contrast to show that while false teachers may lead some people away from the faith, the foundation, the church, is strong.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do you make a house strong in your culture? How will you talk about how God's church is strong, like the thing that makes a house strong? Pause this audio here.

We can know the foundation of the church is secure because God marks it with God's seal. Paul explains the seal with two phrases from the Old Testament. The first phrase reassures us that God is in control and knows who God's people are. The second phrase reminds us that God's church must be pure, and those people who call God Father must be like God. Those people must seek to turn away from sin and rely on God's faithfulness. In both of these phrases, "Lord" refers to God the Father himself, as these phrases refer to an Old Testament story.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How do people in your culture use old stories, or phrases from old stories, to share wisdom for today? Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it.

You will want to emphasize the contrast between an "approved worker" and a "false teacher." Consider acting out these roles at the same time so that people can see how different the roles are and how these people's actions have different effects. For example, you will want to represent Timothy as the approved worker who correctly teaches the gospel, while the false teacher chatters and teaches in a quarrelsome way. It would also be helpful to show how these different ways affect other people. Emphasize that false teaching makes people spiritually sick and leads to spiritual death, while teaching that is "cut straight," or follows God's word, leads to being more and more like God. Lastly, it would be helpful to represent the church as a physical structure that God's power makes strong. Consider showing how those people who follow Christ gather together to form this building as they stop sinning or following the rebellious ways of the false teachers.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* People in the church
* And the false teachers, Hymenaeus and Philetus

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

In part one, Paul tells Timothy to remind people in the church of the truth of the gospel and to not participate in arguments with false teachers who are telling lies about Jesus.

Pause the drama.

Ask a person playing the people in the church, "What are you feeling or thinking about this warning not to argue about words?" The person might answer things like:

* The good news is so good that I do not have to be afraid and get into arguments if someone tries to speak against it; or
* I am glad that the truth is clear. I feel like I can rest in the truth. What the false teachers say is confusing and unsettling. When I argue with the false teachers, I feel defeated and tired.

In part two, Paul explains the difference between what Timothy should do as an "approved worker" and how the false teachers behave and teach. Timothy should eagerly work to be pleasing to God by teaching the good news, as Paul has taught Timothy the good news. Paul is an approved worker who teaches the truth to Timothy, so Timothy can be an approved worker. This includes staying away from "godless chatter" that will make people spiritually sick and less like God. Paul then mentions Hymenaeus and Philetus as examples of what not to do.

Pause the drama.

Ask a person playing Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking about Paul's instruction on how to deal with false teaching?" The person might answer things like:

* I am encouraged that I have a friend like Paul who reminds me of what is true and how to pursue that truth. It gives me hope; or
* I can see how serious this problem is, and I am glad there is a clear way to fight against it.

Ask a person playing the people in the church, "What are you feeling or thinking about Hymenaeus and Philetus as compared with Timothy?" The person might answer things like:

* Timothy speaks clearly and respectfully, but Hymenaeus and Philetus seem to be angry, and they confuse me; or
* I feel like Hymenaeus and Philetus make it harder to know God, but when Timothy teaches, I feel closer to God.

In part three, Paul tells Timothy that God's chosen people, God's church, is like a well\-built building that has God's identifying mark on it, God's seal. The seal contains two phrases that remind Timothy of how God has preserved God's people in the past and kept those people pure. The first phrase says that God knows who God's people are. The second phrase says that those who claim to be God's people must move away from evil. Paul uses specific phrases from the Old Testament that would remind Timothy and others in the church of how God deals with rebellion against those God has placed in authority.

Pause the drama.

Ask a person playing Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking about Paul's statements here?" The person might answer things like:

* It is such a relief to be reminded that God knows who each of God's people are and that we are safe. I am excited to share that reminder with the church; or
* I see how important it is that, as a follower of Jesus, I leave behind all that is evil because it is not part of my identity anymore.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul tells Timothy that Timothy needs to correctly teach or rightly handle the **word of truth**. This phrase means "the gospel," and Paul uses the phrase this way clearly in other books, specifically in Paul's letter to the Colossians and in Paul's letter to the Ephesians. Use the same word or phrase for "word of truth" as you used in previous passages. For more information, you can refer to word in the Master Glossary.

Paul tells Timothy to avoid the **godless chatter** of the false teachers. This is when people talk a lot foolishly in a way that does not please God. You will have already translated this phrase in Paul's first letter to Timothy. Use the same word or phrase for "godless chatter" as you used in previous passages.

Paul tells Timothy that the godless chatter of the false teachers will lead people to be more and more **ungodly**. When someone is godly, that person respects God as holy, and that leads that person to correct behavior and to become more like God. When someone is ungodly, that person does not have a correct knowledge of God, and that leads that person to incorrect behavior.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will talk about people who are **ungodly**. For more information, refer to godly in the Master Glossary. If you have already translated this concept in a previous book of the Bible, use a similar way to describe ungodly here. Pause this audio here.

Hymenaeus and Philetus have said that the believers' **resurrection** has already happened. When Hymenaeus and Philetus say this, it destroys the **faith** of some people. Describe faith, or belief, in the same way you have described it in previous passages. Remember that faith is in the Master Glossary.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will talk about the **resurrection**. Refer to resurrection in the Master Glossary for more information. Pause this audio here.

Paul tells Timothy that God has put God's **seal** on the foundation of God's church. This means that God has marked the church as God's own, and this guarantees God's protection. God uses the idea of a seal throughout the Bible to represent God's ownership and protection. In this passage, Paul compares the seal to a seal on a building's foundation.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **seal**. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul's quotes from the Old Testament refer to God as **Lord**. Use the same word or phrase for Lord when it refers to God the Father as you used in previous passages. For more information on Lord, refer to the Master Glossary.

In the quote at the end of the passage, Paul tells Timothy that those who call themselves followers of Jesus must depart from unrighteousness or **wickedness**, or stop acting in an unrighteous or wicked way. Unrighteousness or wickedness is anything contrary to truth. The lies of the false teachers lead others to act in an unrighteous way because the false teachers lead other people to believe what is not true about God. Use the same word or phrase for unrighteousness or wickedness as you used in previous passages.

Stop here and discuss as a group: How will you talk about people who need to turn away from or stop being wicked or unrighteous? Refer to the Master Glossary for more information about wickedness. Because wickedness is the opposite of righteousness, you may also refer to the Master Glossary for righteousness for more ideas about how to translate wickedness.

Setting the Stage

Setting the Stage

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 2:20–26 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In the previous section of Paul's letter, Paul gave Timothy advice on how to recognize and deal with false teachers in the church. The false teachers would argue about the meaning of words. The false teachers' arguing would not help anyone. Instead, this arguing would often ruin those people who listened to the false teachers. In addition, the false teachers would start foolish discussions and cause people to act in an ungodly way. Paul encouraged Timothy to teach the word of truth, or the gospel, accurately.

Paul begins this section of Paul's second letter to Timothy with an example of a large house. Paul is likely thinking of the house of someone very rich in first\-century Ephesus. In this large house, there would be all sorts of vessels and pottery of various materials. Some vessels are gold and silver vessels. Other vessels are wood and baked clay vessels. The vessels of gold and silver are vessels of "honor." People use these vessels for special occasions and set these vessels out on the shelf for everyone to see. The vessels of wood and baked clay are vessels of "dishonor." People use these vessels for common things such as garbage bins or toilets.

Paul uses the example of the large house with different vessels to encourage Timothy to be like the vessels that people use for "honorable" reasons. Timothy could accomplish this by avoiding doing what the false teachers do. When a person avoids doing what false teachers do, God can use that person for God's good purposes, like a person uses gold and silver vessels for good purposes.

Stop here and look at pictures of gold vessels and clay vessels. Discuss these questions as a group: What types of vessels do you have in your home? How do you use the different vessels for different purposes in your home? Pause this audio here.

Although Timothy is a leader, Timothy is also a young man. In a previous letter, Paul told Timothy to not allow people to look down on Timothy because of Timothy's youth. Instead, Timothy was to set an example through Timothy's speech and how Timothy behaved. Here, Paul instructs Timothy to run *away* from the youthful passions like a person runs away from dangerous things. Youthful passions or desires are things that young people often want to do that do not follow God's laws. Sometimes these desires are sexual sins. Because these passions are very attractive, Timothy has to be very careful to avoid them. Instead, Timothy should run *towards* qualities that go along with living as a follower of Jesus, such as having a right relationship with God, committing to follow Jesus, loving God and the people around Timothy, and having a peaceful relationship with everyone. Paul wants Timothy to practice these qualities along with other believers.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What are some passions, or strong desires, that young people often have that are bad for them? What are some things, or passions, that you now avoid doing because you are older, or because you are a believer in Jesus? Pause this audio here.

During this time, people in the Roman Empire liked to publicly discuss wisdom and knowledge. It was common for people to passionately discuss social issues and personal opinions. Remember that Paul had encountered these sorts of people when Paul met philosophers in Athens. Paul concludes this section when Paul instructs Timothy on the best way to handle false teachers who love to talk and get into useless discussions. Instead of joining these people in meaningless talk, Timothy was to be patient with these people and correct them gently. Hopefully, Timothy could lead these people to repent or turn away from their behavior and start doing the right things. Then the people would understand the truth and be able to escape the devil. The devil tries to trap people, like a hunter traps an animal in a trap. The devil wants to make those people the devil's prisoners so that those people will do what the devil wants those people to do.

Stop here and look at a photo of a snare or an animal trap.

Defining the Scenes

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 2:20–26 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has three parts.

**In the first part:** Paul compares people to vessels or containers in a large house. This is likely the house of a wealthy person. Some vessels are made of precious metals and people use those vessels for special occasions. Other vessels are made of wood or clay and people use those vessels for ordinary uses. Paul tells Timothy that if a person cleanses himself of the behavior of the false teachers, that person will become a vessel of honor.

**In the second part:** In order to encourage Timothy to be a vessel of honor, Paul tells Timothy to run away from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace. Paul wants Timothy to be very careful to not do the wrong things and to be very careful to choose the right things. This would be like a person who runs away from danger and runs towards safety. Timothy is to run towards safety with other believers who follow God with a pure heart.

**In the third part:** Paul teaches Timothy the best way to handle false teachers. Paul encourages Timothy to correct those people with gentleness.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* False teachers
* Other believers
* And the devil

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

In the first part, the big house represents the church. People use both vessels of honor and dishonor inside this big house. However, people use the vessels of honor for special purposes. People use the vessels of dishonor for common purposes. Paul compares the vessels of honor to the people God, our master, uses for God's purposes. Paul compares the vessels of dishonor to the false teachers. A person can be like a vessel of honor by staying away from the errors of the false teachers. Paul says believers should clean themselves like they clean a dirty vessel. Paul is not telling believers that the believers should wash their bodies with water like a person washes a dirty vessel with water, but that believers should stop doing evil things or following false teachers.

Stop here and discuss as a group: How will you talk about the people cleaning themselves so that the people can become vessels of honor? Pause this audio here.

Paul continues to explain how Timothy can become a vessel of honor. Paul now teaches Timothy how to avoid the sinful lusts, or passions, common to young men. Paul compares Timothy to someone who must run away from dangerous things. In the same way, Timothy must run away from sinful passions that many young men have. The fact that Timothy has to "run away" shows that Timothy must make a strong effort to resist these youthful lusts. When Timothy runs away from sin, Timothy runs towards good actions. Paul tells Timothy to act in a way that is righteous, faithful, loving, and peaceful. In other words, Timothy should be righteous, or be in a right relationship with God. Timothy should be faithful, meaning that Timothy should do what God has asked Timothy to do. Timothy should love God and love others. And finally, Timothy should be peaceful, or have good relationships with other people. Paul says Timothy should run towards these qualities with other believers who have a pure heart. These other believers are also like honorable vessels who desire to act with these same characteristics. These believers "call on God," which means that these believers "worship God" or "pray to God." These believers worship or pray to God with a pure or clean heart, which means that these believers have a good relationship with God.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will describe people who call on God with a pure heart. Pause this audio here.

In the third part, Paul calls Timothy the Lord's servant. Paul may be referring to all people who serve the Lord as pastors or workers in the church. Paul tells Timothy the most effective method for the Lord's servant to handle the false teachers in the church. Paul instructs Timothy to refuse to participate in foolish or meaningless discussions and debates about unimportant things. The devil traps people in these debates like a hunter traps animals in a snare. The devil wants to trap people so that people do what the devil wants people to do and not what God wants people to do. However, Timothy should teach the people and correct errors *gently* in the hope that Timothy's opponents will repent and accept the truth of God's word.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. As you do this, you might want to have drawings or objects to represent Paul, Timothy, and items from the story, such as the vessels.

Remember that Paul is teaching Timothy how to become a person whom God can use for every good purpose. Paul begins with the story of a large house with different kinds of vessels. You can have a team member enter a room with two bowls. The person could place one of the bowls on a shelf and put a candle inside that bowl. The person could then place the other bowl on the floor and throw trash inside that bowl. These bowls represent the vessels of honor and the vessels of dishonor.

Paul tells Timothy how a person can become someone God can use. Paul tells Timothy to avoid the behavior of the false teachers and to avoid youthful lusts. Paul encourages Timothy to practice good behaviors with other believers. You can have the team member dump the trash out of the second bowl and wash the bowl. The team member can then place the washed bowl on the shelf and put a candle inside that bowl. This represents a person becoming clean and God using that person for a better purpose.

The team member playing Timothy could stand between two groups of people. One group can represent the bad things that Timothy should avoid. The other group can represent the good that Timothy runs towards. Other team members can join Timothy as Timothy moves towards the good group. Show that Timothy purposely avoids people on the side who are arguing with each other.

Show Timothy's opponents trapped in something. Timothy gently instructs these opponents. As Timothy instructs the opponents, the opponents become free from the trap.

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 2:20–26 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has three parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* False teachers
* Other believers
* And the devil

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says that there are two kinds of vessels—gold and silver vessels that people use for important things, and wood and clay vessels that people use for common things. If people clean themselves, those people will be like the gold and silver vessels that people use for honorable or important things. God will be able to use those people.

Pause the drama.

Ask the people playing Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" A person might answer:

* After I wash the bowl clean, I should no longer use that bowl for trash; or
* I am so happy that God can truly use us when we are clean!

In the second part, Paul tells Timothy that Timothy should run away from evil desires and do things that are righteous, faithful, loving, and peaceful. Timothy should do this with other people who also love Jesus and try to live this way.

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" A person might answer:

* But I like doing these things! It is difficult to stop doing these things! or
* I am so glad that Paul said I should have other people with me! I will not feel so alone!

In the last part, Paul tells Timothy to not fight and argue but to correct Timothy's opponents gently. Paul explains that these opponents have fallen into the trap of the devil. If these people repent of their error, these people can escape the trap.

Pause the drama.

Ask one of the false teachers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" A person might answer:

* I am glad I am out of that trap; or
* I did not notice that I was in a trap.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 2:20–26 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul says that if people clean themselves, God will make those people **holy**, or God will set those people apart for God's special purposes. Use the same word for holy that you have used previously, and refer to the Master Glossary for holy.

Paul compares people who do right and people who do wrong with different types of vessels. The vessels of gold and silver are honorable and useful for the **master**. Here, the master is someone who is in charge of all of the servants inside a home. In this passage, this word refers to God, who is master over everyone.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word you will use for **master** here. See the Master Glossary for a full definition of master. Pause the audio here.

Paul tells Timothy to run away from youthful passions and chase after the qualities of **righteousness**, love, faith, and peace. When people believe in Jesus, God makes those people **righteous**, which means those people have a good relationship with God.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **righteousness**. Use the same word for righteousness that you have used in previous books in the Bible. See the Master Glossary for more information about righteousness. Pause this audio here.

Use the same words for **faith**, **peace**, and **love** as you have used in previous passages. If needed, see the Master Glossary for full definitions of faith and peace.

Paul says that Timothy should chase after good qualities with other believers who also have a **pure heart**. People with a pure heart are people who also want to follow Jesus very well. Those people do not think about following anyone else but Jesus.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for "pure heart." Use the same words for pure and for heart that you have used in previous books in the Bible. See the Master Glossary for more information about pure and heart. Pause this audio here.

Because Timothy is a **slave** or **servant** of the **Lord**, Timothy must not get involved in heated discussions. A servant is someone who works for another person, usually without pay. A servant of God works for God. Use the same word for Lord that you have used previously, and refer to the Master Glossary for more information about Lord.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **servant**. Look up servant in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Hopefully, the opponents of Timothy would come to **repentance**, or repent, and know the truth. When a person repents, that person is sorry for the things they have done, and that person wants to change. That person stops doing the bad things and starts obeying God.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **repentance**. Look up repent in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul says that if someone repents, that person will escape the trap of the **devil**. The devil is the same as Satan. The devil is the leader of all the evil spirits.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **devil**. Look up devil in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there.

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 3:1–9 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

Paul has finished teaching Timothy about how to handle those people who oppose the truth. Now, Paul wants Timothy to understand something important about the last days. These last days began when Jesus came to earth and will continue until Jesus returns. Paul warns that difficult and dangerous times will come. People will cause trouble and create hardship during these periods. Christians will face challenges that could make those Christians question or doubt their beliefs. The troubles Paul describes are about to happen, not far in the future. Christians need to be aware that Christians are living in these last days. Paul is not sharing new information with Timothy. Instead, Paul is reminding Timothy about what Timothy already knows.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about a time when someone warned you about a difficult situation that was coming. How did that warning help you prepare? What would have happened if you had not received the warning? Pause this audio here.

Paul lists many bad qualities these people will have in no particular order. These people will love themselves more than others. These people will love money more than doing what is right. These people will brag about themselves and think they are very important. These people will be proud and look down on others. These people will say mean things about other people and about God. These people will disobey their parents. These people will not be thankful for what others do for these people. These people will not care about what God wants or about doing what is good. These people will not love other people or show kindness. These people will not forgive people who hurt them, even when those people say they are sorry. These people will tell lies about other people to hurt those people. These people will not control their actions or their words. These people will act as viciously as wild animals. These people will hate anything that is good or right. These people will turn against their friends when it benefits these people. These people will act without thinking about the consequences. These people will think they are better than everyone else. These people will love pleasure and comfort more than they love God.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Listen to this list of bad qualities. Which of these qualities do you see most often in your community? How do these qualities hurt relationships between people? Pause this audio here.

These people will pretend to follow God and be "godly." These people will go to religious meetings and say religious words. But these people's actions will show that these people do not really know or believe in God's power. These people do not let the Holy Spirit change their attitudes or their behavior. Paul tells Timothy to stay away from people like this. Timothy should not join in these people's activities or support what these people teach. These people are dangerous to the church and could lead others to turn away from believing in God.

Paul strongly warns Timothy to stay away from these people. These false teachers have specific ways they try to spread their wrong ideas. These false teachers secretly go into homes and especially target certain women. In the ancient world, false teachers from many different religious groups often tried to deceive women in those women's homes. Some false teachers may have focused on women because they offered new religious rules about women's roles in the home and community. The false teachers look for women who carry the weight of past wrongs. These women feel guilty for what they have done in the past, and these women search for happiness by following their evil desires. Therefore, these women are more likely to believe the teachings of the false teachers.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about times when people want to learn something new. What makes it hard to know if a teacher is telling the truth? What can help people recognize false teaching? Pause this audio here.

Paul compares these false teachers to two men from Israel's history. Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses when Moses was trying to lead God's people out of Egypt. These men were magicians of the King of Egypt. These men tried to copy the miracles God did through Moses. In the same way, these false teachers in Timothy's church oppose the truth about God. These false teachers try to make their own teaching look like God's truth, but this teaching is fake. These false teachers cannot think clearly about God's truth because their minds are confused. These teachers' faith is worthless because they have rejected God's real truth.

Paul gives Timothy hope about this situation. These false teachers will not succeed for long. These teachers might fool some people for a while. These teachers might even look successful at first. But eventually, everyone will see how foolish these false teachers are. This is exactly what happened to Jannes and Jambres. At first, Jannes and Jambres could copy some of Moses' miracles. But soon everyone saw that Jannes and Jambres could not really do what Moses did with God's power. In the same way, everyone will see that these false teachers in Timothy's church do not have God's truth or power.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Share a time when something that looked good at first turned out to be false or fake. How did people discover the truth? What happened to the person who was trying to fool other people? Pause this audio here.

Paul wants Timothy to understand this warning so Timothy can protect the church. Timothy needs to recognize these kinds of people. Timothy needs to help believers recognize false teachers. The church needs to stay strong in God's truth. Even though these will be difficult times, God's truth will win in the end.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 3:1–9 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has four parts.

**In the first part:** Paul warns Timothy about terrible times that will come in the last days. Paul describes the evil qualities of the people who will live in these times.

**In the second part:** Paul tells Timothy what these false teachers do. These teachers secretly enter homes and convince women who feel guilty about their sins to follow this false teaching.

**In the third part:** Paul compares these false teachers to Jannes and Jambres, who opposed Moses. Paul explains how these false teachers in Timothy's church are like those ancient opponents.

**In the fourth part:** Paul gives Timothy hope by explaining that these false teachers will not succeed for long. Everyone will see how foolish these teachers are.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* False teachers
* Women whom the false teachers target
* Jannes and Jambres
* And Moses

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Paul is writing to Timothy from prison. Paul knows that Paul will die soon. Paul wants to make sure Timothy understands how to lead the church after Paul is gone. Paul has just finished telling Timothy how to deal with people who oppose the truth. Now Paul warns Timothy about difficult times ahead. Paul describes what these times will be like and who will cause trouble. Paul uses an example from Israel's history to help Timothy understand. Then Paul gives Timothy hope that these false teachers will not succeed.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about a time when someone needed to warn others about danger. What information did that person include in their warning? How did that person help people understand the danger? Pause this audio here.

In the first part of this passage, Paul tells Timothy that terrible times will come in the last days. Paul understood the last days as the time that began when Jesus came to earth. These last days will continue until Jesus returns at the end of the earth to judge all people. Most people who read this passage believe Paul means these last days will be difficult because of how people will behave. Paul lists many evil qualities that people will show during these times. Paul does not arrange these qualities in any particular order.

Paul begins by describing how people will love themselves too much. All the other evil qualities are a form of loving oneself too much. These people will love money. These people will be proud or think of themselves as better than others. These people will say mean things to other people. These people will not obey or respect their parents. These people will not show thankfulness to God or to other people. These people will not care about God. These people will not love other people or forgive other people. These people will act with cruelty, almost like wild animals act. These people will not be able to control their own actions. These people will hate good things. These people will love pleasure more than they love God. These people will act religious but will not really believe in God's power in their lives.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Listen to this list of evil qualities. Paul tells Timothy strongly to stay away from these people. But earlier, Paul taught Timothy to correct opponents gently. How can we know when to avoid someone or when to help that person understand the truth? Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss as a group: How will you list these evil qualities in your translation? Practice listing the qualities until you feel like you are describing the qualities correctly. Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul explains what these false teachers do. These teachers secretly enter homes. These teachers look for people who will be easy to convince and gain control over. These teachers target women who feel guilty about their sins and who look for happiness in evil desires. These women always want to learn new things about God. But these women need to learn the real truth. The false teachers take advantage of these women's desires to learn.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Have you seen people in your community who quickly believe anything they hear? What makes these people believe these false things so easily? How will you describe in your language these kinds of people who want to learn but who accept wrong teachings too quickly? What words or phrases will help your community understand this warning? Pause this audio here.

In the third part, Paul compares these false teachers to two men from Israel's history. Jannes and Jambres were magicians who opposed Moses in Egypt. These men tried to copy God's miracles that Moses performed. In the same way, these false teachers in Timothy's church oppose God's truth. These teachers try to make their teaching look like God's truth, but it is fake. These teachers' minds are confused, and their faith is worthless.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Paul compares the false teachers in Timothy's church to the magicians Jannes and Jambres. How are these false teachers like those magicians? How will you talk about how those two men opposed Moses like these false teachers now oppose true teaching? Pause this audio here.

In the fourth part, Paul encourages Timothy. These false teachers will not succeed for long. These teachers might fool some people at first. But everyone will see how foolish these teachers are. This is what happened to Jannes and Jambres. Jannes and Jambres' minds stopped working correctly because Jannes and Jambres chose to oppose God's truth. Jannes and Jambres could no longer tell the difference between what was true and what was false. Jannes and Jambres could copy some of Moses' miracles at first. But soon everyone saw that Jannes and Jambres did not have God's power. The same thing will happen to these false teachers in Timothy's church.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Paul says these people have corrupted minds. This means these people's minds cannot think clearly about what is true anymore because these people chose to go against God. What words or phrases in your language describe a mind that no longer works correctly? How do people in your community describe someone who can no longer recognize the truth? Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. As you do this, you might want to use drawings, objects, or even people to represent Paul writing from prison, Timothy reading the letter, the false teachers sneaking into homes, the women these teachers target, and Jannes and Jambres opposing Moses. Consider drawing or acting out both the present situation with the false teachers and the historical story of Moses and the magicians to show how the situations are similar.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has four parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* False teachers
* Women whom the false teachers target
* Jannes and Jambres
* And Moses

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul writes to Timothy, "You must understand this: In the last days, terrible times will come. People will love themselves and money. People will brag and be proud. People will say mean things about others. People will not obey their parents. People will not be thankful or respect what God says is right. People will not love others or forgive those people. People will tell lies about people. People will not control themselves. People will be cruel and hate what is good. People will turn against their friends. People will act without thinking. People will think they are better than other people. People will love pleasure more than God. People will act religious but deny God's power. Stay away from people like this!"

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am worried about how I will lead the church when I see these things; or
* I need to warn the believers about these kinds of people so the believers can stay strong; or
* This helps me understand why some people in our church are causing problems.

Paul continues and says, "These are the kind of teachers who secretly enter homes. These teachers find women who feel guilty about their sins. These women always want to learn new things, but these women never learn the truth. These women follow whatever these teachers say."

Pause the drama.

Ask a person playing one of the false teachers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* If I target people who feel guilty, I can convince those people to follow my teaching; or
* I will say whatever these women want to hear so the women will listen to me; or
* I know my teaching is false, but I want people to follow me instead of God's truth.

Ask a person playing one of these women, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel so guilty about my sins. Maybe this new teaching will help me feel better; or
* I want to learn about God, but I am not sure what is true anymore; or
* These teachers sound wise, but something does not feel right about their teaching.

Paul explains, "These teachers are just like Jannes and Jambres, who opposed Moses. These false teachers also oppose the truth. These teachers' minds are confused, and their faith is worthless."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Moses, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I remember when these magicians tried to copy God's miracles, but the magicians could not match God's power; or
* God showed everyone that these magicians were fake by giving me real power; or
* People could see the difference between God's truth and the magicians' tricks.

Paul concludes when he says, "But these false teachers will not succeed for long. Everyone will see how foolish these teachers are, just like everyone saw how foolish Jannes and Jambres were."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I need to help Timothy understand that God's truth will win in the end; or
* I have seen false teachers before, and those teachers always fail eventually; or
* I want to encourage Timothy to stay strong and keep teaching God's truth.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

The **last days** refer to the time period that began when Jesus came to earth and will continue until Jesus returns to judge the people in the world. This includes both the present time and the future. When Paul talks about the last days, Paul is talking about things happening in his time and things that will continue to happen.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for "last days." Think about how you describe a time period that includes both now and the future. If you have already translated this phrase in another book of the Bible, use a similar phrase to the one you used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul says these people will be **lovers of themselves**. These people love only themselves. These people care only about their own needs. These people ignore other people's needs. These people put themselves first in every situation.

Paul says these people will be **lovers of money**. These people love money above all else. These people seek money constantly. These people let their desire for money control their choices.

Paul says these people will be **boastful**. These people brag about themselves constantly. These people tell everyone about their achievements. These people want other people to praise them.

Paul says these people will be **proud**. These people believe they rank above other people. These people look down on everyone else. These people refuse to admit their mistakes.

Paul says these people will be **abusive**. These people speak cruel words to hurt other people. These people insult other people. These people mock God and other people.

Paul says these people will be **disobedient to their parents**. These people rebel against their parents. These people disrespect their parents. These people reject their parents' guidance.

Paul says these people will be **ungrateful**. These people ignore kindness from other people. These people fail to thank other people who help them. These people take good things for granted.

Paul says these people will be **unholy**. These people reject God's ways. These people choose evil over good. These people live in ways that dishonor God.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **unholy**. Think about words in your language that describe people who do not respect God or God's ways. This is a similar idea to being ungodly. Look up ungodly in the Master Glossary for more information. Pause this audio here.

Paul says these people will be **without love**. These people show no kindness to other people. These people ignore people in need. These people lack compassion for anyone else.

Paul says these people will be **unforgiving**, or refuse to reconcile with other people. These people hold onto anger. These people refuse to make peace. These people remember every wrong that other people have done to them.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will describe people who refuse to forgive others. For more information, refer to forgiveness in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.

Paul says these people will be **slanderous**. To slander means to say false things about people to hurt those people's reputation. Slanderers try to damage other people by spreading lies about those people. This word can also refer to the devil, who is called "the slanderer," because the devil tells lies about God and people.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **slanderous**. Think about words in your language that describe people who deliberately spread lies to hurt other people. If you have already translated an idea like this in another book of the Bible, use the same word you used there. Pause this audio here.

Paul says these people will be **without self\-control**. These people follow every impulse. These people do whatever they want. These people give in to all temptations.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for "without self\-control." Think about words in your language that describe people who cannot control their behavior.

Paul says these people will be **brutal**. These people act with cruelty. These people behave like wild animals. These people hurt other people on purpose.

Paul says these people will not be **lovers of the good**. These people hate what is right. These people choose evil over good. These people reject God's standards.

Paul says these people will be **treacherous**. These people betray their friends. These people break their promises. These people turn against people who trust them.

Paul says these people will be **rash**. These people act without thinking. These people make hasty decisions. These people speak before considering their words.

Paul says these people will be **conceited**. These people think too highly of themselves. These people believe they know everything. These people refuse to learn from others.

Paul says these people will be **lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God**. These people choose pleasure over God. These people want their own enjoyment first. These people value fun more than following God.

These people claim to have **godliness**. When someone is godly, or has godliness, that person lives in a way that honors and pleases God. But the false teachers that Paul talks about only pretend to be godly. These people do religious activities but do not truly follow God. In these letters, Paul often describes people with genuine devotion to God as "godly" and false teachers as ungodly.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **godliness**. Think about words in your language that describe both real and fake religious behavior. How do you talk about the difference between people who truly follow God and those who just pretend? Refer to godly again in the Master Glossary if needed. If you have already translated this idea of godliness in another book of the Bible, describe godliness in the same way you have described it there. Pause this audio here.

The women these false teachers target feel loaded down with **sin**. Sin is any act of disobedience against God or rebellion against God's commands. These women feel guilty because of their past sins and are looking for relief from their guilt.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **sin**. Think about words in your language that describe disobedience against God and the guilt people feel because of disobedience. Refer to the Master Glossary for sin. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word you used there. Pause this audio here.

**Faith** refers to a person's genuine relationship with God. When a person has faith in God, that person believes or trusts in God. These false teachers have been tested in their faith and have failed. These teachers' relationship with God has been shown to be fake. Describe faith here in the same way as you have previously, and refer to the Master Glossary for more information about faith.

Setting the Stage

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 3:10–17 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this part of the letter, Paul urges Timothy to follow Paul's example. Paul shows the difference between what the false teachers do and what Paul does. The false teachers spread lies. The false teachers look successful even though those teachers do evil things. Paul took a different path. Paul taught the truth about God. Paul lived in a way that pleased God.

Paul tells Timothy that Timothy has followed Paul's example well. Timothy knows about Paul's teaching and way of life. Timothy understands Paul's purpose and faith. Timothy has seen Paul's patience and love. Timothy has watched how Paul keeps going even when things are hard and how Paul responds when other people persecute Paul for following Christ.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about someone who has been a good example to you in your life. What things did that person do that showed you how to live well? What did you learn from watching that person? Pause this audio here.

Paul reminds Timothy about times when people persecuted Paul in different cities. These events happened during Paul's first missionary journey. Antioch was an important Roman city where Paul preached for a while. Jewish leaders turned people against Paul and forced Paul to leave.

In Iconium, a city on important trade routes that connected Macedonia, Achaia, and Asia with Rome, some people planned to stone Paul. In Lystra, an angry crowd threw stones at Paul until those people thought Paul had died. The crowd dragged Paul's body outside the city and believed Paul was dead. Stoning was a violent form of attack where people would throw rocks at someone until that person died from the injuries. But the Lord Jesus saved Paul from all these troubles. Timothy joined Paul's ministry just a few months after these events happened, so Timothy knew these stories well. Since Timothy came from the region around Lystra and Iconium, Timothy had heard directly from local believers about how Paul had suffered in these cities.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell about a time when you chose to do the right thing even though that thing was hard. What made that thing difficult? What helped you keep doing the right thing? Pause this audio here.

Paul teaches that everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will face difficult times. God's people have always faced opposition. Evil people and false teachers continue to trick other people. These false teachers grow worse over time. False teachers deceive other people while Satan deceives those false teachers. All this occurs during the "last days" that Paul described earlier.

Paul encourages Timothy to continue to believe what Timothy has learned. Timothy can trust these teachings because Timothy knows the people who taught Timothy. Timothy learned about God from Timothy's family since Timothy was very young. Timothy's mother was Jewish, and Timothy's father was Greek. Timothy's mother and grandmother taught Timothy the Jewish Scriptures—what we now call the Old Testament—from the time Timothy was a young child. These Scriptures included the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and other sacred Jewish writings. Timothy would have learned this Scripture in the Greek language, because Timothy grew up in a Greek\-speaking area.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about a time when someone taught you something important. What made that person's teaching easy to understand? What helped you remember what that person taught you? Pause this audio here.

Paul explains that God breathed out all Scripture. This means that Scripture comes from God. This does not mean God told people exactly what words to write. Instead, God worked with the human writers to produce exactly what God wanted. Paul emphasizes that Scripture comes directly from God to explain why Scripture accomplishes God's purposes. Because Scripture comes from God, Scripture can effectively teach people what is true. Scripture shows people when those people do wrong. Scripture helps people fix their mistakes. Scripture trains people to live right. These four functions of Scripture help God's people confront false teachers well.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What are some ways you use the Bible to help you make decisions or know what is right? How does knowing what the Bible says help you follow God better? Pause this audio here.

God gave us Scripture to make God's people complete and ready to do every good work God has asked people to do. In the Old Testament, God called Moses and the prophets his "men of God." Paul now uses this special title for Timothy because Timothy will continue the work of teaching God's truth, just as Moses and the prophets did long ago. The Scriptures give Timothy everything Timothy needs for this important task.

Paul's own life shows how someone can use Scripture and endure hard times. When false teachers misuse the Scriptures, Paul uses the Scriptures correctly to show God's truth. When people resist the gospel, Paul keeps teaching even though it brings suffering. Timothy must follow this example as Timothy leads the church.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about a time when you heard something in the Bible that helped you understand God better. What did you learn? How did it change the way you think about God? Pause this audio here.

Now that Paul has explained these important truths, Paul will give Timothy more instructions about leading the church. The Scriptures will help Timothy recognize false teaching, teach God's truth, and lead the church well during difficult times. Paul is ready to give Timothy Paul's final message in the next part of Paul's letter.

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 3:10–17 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has four parts.

**In the first part:** Paul describes how Timothy has followed Paul's example. Paul describes nine characteristics of Paul's ministry that Timothy has observed. Paul begins with how Paul teaches God's truth, and ends with the hardships Paul has faced for sharing that truth.

**In the second part:** Paul tells about specific times people persecuted Paul in different cities. Paul explains that the Lord rescued Paul from all these troubles. Paul then teaches that everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will face persecution.

**In the third part:** Paul instructs Timothy to continue in what Timothy has learned. Paul reminds Timothy about learning the holy Scriptures since childhood. Paul explains that Scripture leads to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.

**In the fourth part:** Paul explains how God breathes, or gives, Scripture. Scripture is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* Evil people and false teachers
* Timothy's mother and grandmother
* God
* Christ Jesus, the Lord
* And God's man, or God's servant

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Paul is writing to Timothy while Paul is in prison. Paul has just finished warning Timothy about the dangerous people who will appear in the last days. Now, Paul contrasts these evil people with Paul's own way of life. Paul reminds Timothy of events from Paul's first missionary journey. These events happened in the cities of Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. Timothy joined Paul's ministry not long after these events. Paul uses Paul's experiences to teach Timothy about faithful ministry during difficult times.

Paul is preparing Timothy to continue the work of ministry after Paul is gone. To do this, Paul reminds Timothy of the true teaching Timothy has learned. Paul connects this teaching to the holy Scriptures that Timothy has known since childhood. Paul wants Timothy to understand that Scripture gives everything Timothy needs to serve God well.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about a time when someone taught you an important skill. How did that person show you what to do? How did that person help you learn to do that thing yourself? Pause this audio here.

In the first part of this passage, Paul lists nine good qualities about Paul's ministry, in direct contrast to the evil behaviors Paul just described in the false teachers who live in the last days. Paul talks about how Paul teaches God's truth and lives each day following God. Paul describes how Paul keeps Paul's purpose of sharing the good news about Jesus. Paul shows how Paul trusts God in everything, remains patient with difficult people, and loves others even when it costs Paul something. Paul ends the list by saying that Paul endured hardship and persecution.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What are some words or phrases from the passage that show what Timothy observed in Paul's life? Try listing these things in the order that Paul lists them, starting with Paul's teaching and ending with Paul's suffering. Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul describes specific times of persecution. In Antioch, people forced Paul to leave the city. In Iconium, people threatened to stone Paul. In Lystra, people did stone Paul and thought Paul was dead. But the Lord rescued Paul from all these troubles. Then Paul states a strong truth: in fact, every person who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will face persecution.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Listen to how Paul describes what happened to Paul in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. What words or phrases does Paul use to show that these difficult times did not stop Paul from following Jesus? What does Paul say about how God helped Paul during these times? Pause this audio here.

Paul describes evil people who pretend to be something they are not. These false teachers lie to others and act like they teach the truth about God. Paul says these people will keep moving in the wrong direction. These people will become more wicked over time. Although Paul does not use Satan's name, Paul is implying that, as the false teachers trick other people, Satan tricks the teachers too. These false teachers think they make progress, but really, the teachers move further away from God's truth.

In the third part, Paul tells Timothy to continue doing the things Timothy has learned. Timothy can trust these teachings because Timothy learned them from Paul and other faithful teachers. You will remember that Timothy's mother and grandmother taught Timothy the holy Scriptures from childhood. These Scriptures help people understand God's wisdom and point the way to Jesus Christ. Because people have faith in Jesus, or believe in Jesus, people receive God's gift of salvation.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about someone who taught you important truths about God when you were young. How did that person teach you? What words or phrases would you use to describe why you trust what that person taught? Share with the group how you still use that person's teachings to understand God's word today. Pause this audio here.

In the fourth part, Paul explains that all Scripture comes from God. Paul uses a special word that we can translate as either "God\-breathed" or "God\-inspired." When Paul talks about Scripture here, Paul means the Old Testament writings, what we sometimes call the Hebrew Bible. Scripture helps God's people in four ways: Scripture teaches what is true. Scripture shows people when those people are wrong. Scripture helps people fix their mistakes. Scripture trains people to live right.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What words or phrases do you use in your language to explain how God gave us Scripture? Some people say "God breathed the Scriptures," others say "God inspired the Scriptures," and still others might use different words. Share the words or phrases you use to describe how God is the source of Scripture. Pause this audio here.

Paul ends by explaining that God gave us Scripture to make God's people complete and ready for every good work. Paul uses the term "man of God." This title shows someone who serves God faithfully. In the Old Testament, people used the title "man of God" for Moses and the prophets. Now Paul uses this special title for Timothy, because Timothy will continue teaching God's truth like Moses and the prophets did long ago. This title shows us that God wants all God's people, both men and women, to serve God faithfully by doing the good work God has prepared for God's people.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. As you do this, you might want to use drawings, objects, or even people to represent Paul, Timothy, the Lord, the people who persecuted Paul in different cities, Timothy's mother and grandmother, and God. Consider drawing or acting out the scenes of persecution in the three cities, showing how the Lord rescued Paul. Then show how Timothy learned from watching Paul's example and from studying the Scriptures.

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 3:10–17 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has four parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* Evil people and false teachers
* Timothy's mother and grandmother
* God
* Christ Jesus, the Lord
* And God's man, or God's servant

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "Timothy, you have carefully followed my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance, and the persecutions and sufferings I faced. You know what happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I faced terrible persecution in these places, yet the Lord rescued me from all of it."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* Paul's example shows me that following Christ means being willing to face hard times; or
* I am grateful that Paul lets me see both Paul's strengths and Paul's struggles. This helps me know how to serve God faithfully.

Paul says, "In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. Evil people and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and being deceived themselves. But you must continue in what you have learned and firmly believed. You know those who taught you, and from childhood you have known the holy Scriptures."

Pause the drama.

Ask one of the people playing the false teachers, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* We think we know better than Paul. We have new ideas that people want to hear; or
* We do not want to suffer for our faith. We will change the teaching to make it easier; or
* We are sure we are right, but we do not realize we are being deceived ourselves.

Ask the people playing Timothy's mother and grandmother, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The people might answer things like:

* We wanted Timothy to know God's word from Timothy's earliest days. We are glad we taught Timothy faithfully; or
* We see how God used our teaching to prepare Timothy for Timothy's work with Paul; or
* We thank God that Timothy continues to follow the true teachings we shared with Timothy.

Paul says, "The holy Scriptures are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is God\-breathed and useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness, so that God's servant can learn everything they need to be able to do every good work."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I want Timothy to understand how powerful and important God's word is for his ministry; or
* I know my time is short, but I am confident that the Scriptures will guide Timothy after I am gone; or
* I see how God prepared Timothy through Timothy's family and through my example to continue this work.

Ask the person playing God, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I have given my people everything they need in my Scripture. My Scripture will guide my people and help them grow; or
* I see the false teachers trying to lead people astray, but my word will show what is true; or
* I am preparing Timothy through Paul's teaching and through Scripture to serve me faithfully.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 3:10–17 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul says that Timothy knows about Paul's **faith**. When someone has faith, that person trusts God completely. Faith includes believing in Jesus Christ and following Jesus' teachings. People with faith show that faith through both their beliefs and their actions. For more information on faith, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word for faith as you have in previous passages.

Paul faced **persecution** in many cities. When people persecute you, they treat you cruelly and unfairly because you believe in Jesus. People might hurt you physically, force you to leave your home, or spread lies about you.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **persecution**. Think about how you would describe being treated badly for following Jesus. What words in your language describe when someone treats someone else unfairly because of what someone believes? For more information on persecution, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for persecution as you have in previous passages. Pause this audio here.

The **Lord** rescued Paul. In the New Testament, Paul calls Jesus Lord because Jesus is master and God and rules over all things. For more information on Lord, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word for Lord as you have in previous passages.

Everyone who wants to live a **godly** life because they follow **Christ** Jesus will be persecuted. To live a godly life means to live in a way that honors God and follows God's teachings. Godly living combines true faith in God with right behavior. For more information on godly and Christ, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same words or phrases for godly and for Christ as you have in previous passages.

Paul warns about **evildoers** and impostors. Evildoers are people who deliberately do wrong things and lead other people away from the truth. An impostor is someone who pretends to be something they are not, like these false teachers who pretend to teach God's truth but actually teach lies.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for an **evildoer**, or someone who does evil things. For more information on evil, refer to evil in the Master Glossary. Pause this audio here.

The **Scriptures** are the **holy** writings that Timothy learned as a child. When Paul talks about Scripture, Paul means the Jewish holy writings that Christians now call the Old Testament. The Scriptures teach people about God and show people how to live. Use the same word or phrase for holy as you have used previously, and refer to the Master Glossary for more information about holy.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **Scriptures**. Think about how you refer to God's written message to people. What words in your language show that these writings are special and come from God? For more information on Scriptures, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word for Scriptures as you have in previous books of the Bible. Pause this audio here.

Scriptures can make people wise, or give them **wisdom** about salvation from God. Wisdom means understanding what is true and right. Wisdom includes knowing how to live according to God's ways. Wisdom combines knowledge with using that knowledge well.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **wisdom**. What words in your language describe having both knowledge and good judgment? How do you talk about someone who knows the right way to live? For more information on wisdom, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for wisdom as you have in previous passages. Pause this audio here.

**Salvation** is when God saves us from sin because we have faith in, or follow, Jesus Christ. Salvation includes receiving God's forgiveness and eternal life. For more information on salvation, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word for salvation as you have in previous passages.

Scripture trains people in **righteousness**. Righteousness means living in the right way according to God's standards. Righteousness describes behavior that God approves of. For more information on righteousness, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for righteousness as you have in previous passages.

Paul says Scripture is **God\-breathed**, or that God inspired Scripture. This is a special way to show how the Scriptures come from God. Just as a person's breath comes from inside that person, Scripture comes from God himself. God worked with the human writers to produce exactly what God wanted written. Think carefully about how to express this idea in your language.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **God\-breathed**. How would you describe something that comes directly from God? What images in your language could help explain this concept?

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Setting the Stage
-----------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 4:1–8 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this part of the letter, Paul gives Timothy Paul's last set of instructions. Paul makes these instructions very serious by saying that God and Jesus Christ are witnesses. Paul talks about how Jesus will judge everyone when Jesus comes back to Earth to rule Jesus' kingdom completely. In ancient Greece, people used this kind of formal language during special ceremonies when people gave someone an important job or position. Paul makes this such a formal ceremony because Paul knows Paul will die soon.

Paul gives Timothy specific duties. Timothy must proclaim God's message at all times, whether it is convenient or easy to do so, or whether it is not convenient or easy. Paul wants Timothy to be ready and alert for any opportunity. Timothy needs to help people understand when those people have sinned, tell people when someone teaches something wrong about God, and give hope to believers. Timothy must teach these things while staying patient and explaining everything clearly.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell about a time when someone needed to correct you about the way you acted. How did that person do this well or not well? How did you receive that person's message? Pause this audio here.

Paul explains why these instructions are urgent. A time is coming when people will reject the true message about Jesus because those people want to do what feels good. Those people will find many teachers who say what makes those people happy. Those people will always look for new and different teachings that make them feel comfortable, like someone who cannot stop scratching an ear that itches. Those people will turn away from God's truth and believe untrue stories instead.

Timothy must respond differently. Timothy must think clearly and be controlled in all situations. Timothy's work includes suffering as part of spreading the good news about Jesus. Timothy must fully do the work God gave Timothy to do.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about a time when you had to tell someone a truth they did not want to hear. How did you approach the situation? What made the situation difficult? What helped you stay focused on sharing the truth? Pause this audio here.

Paul then talks about Paul's own situation. Paul describes how Paul is giving his life like a person pours out wine for a drink offering in temple worship. In Jewish practice, people poured out wine along with their other sacrifices in the temple. Paul knows that when Paul dies, Paul will be completing his sacrifice of serving God completely.

Paul uses examples from Greek athletic competitions to explain how Paul has lived his life. Paul has worked well like an athlete who has competed well in a contest, finished the race course, and kept the competition rules. Athletes in Paul's time received victory crowns for winning their events.

Stop here and look at a photo of a crown that people might win at a Greek competition. Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Paul uses comparisons from Greek athletic competitions to describe Paul's faithful service. What competitions or contests have you participated in? How do the challenges of training and competing help us understand what it is like to continue working hard on difficult tasks? Pause this audio here.

Paul looks ahead to Paul's reward, which is the crown of righteousness. This phrase combines the picture of the athletic victory crown with the full gift of God's righteousness that God will give to believers when Jesus returns to judge everyone. The Lord Jesus, as the righteous judge, will give this victory crown on the day Jesus returns. Unlike earthly competitions, this reward is not just for Paul but for everyone who eagerly waits for Jesus to come back.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about a time when you had to give an important responsibility to someone else. What did you do to prepare that person? What encouragement did you give that person? How is this similar to what Paul is doing with Timothy?

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 4:1–8 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has four parts.

**In the first part:** Paul gives Timothy a serious charge in the presence of God and Christ Jesus. Paul emphasizes that Christ will judge everyone and will appear to establish Christ's kingdom.

**In the second part:** Paul tells Timothy what Timothy's work is. Timothy must preach God's message, be ready at all times, correct people, correct mistakes, and encourage believers with patient teaching.

**In the third part:** Paul explains why Timothy's work is urgent. People will reject sound teaching and gather teachers who will tell those people what people want to hear. The people will turn from truth to myths, or untrue stories.

**In the fourth part:** Paul talks about Paul's own life coming to an end. Paul uses athletic images to describe how faithfully Paul has served, and Paul looks forward to receiving the crown of righteousness from Jesus.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* God
* Christ Jesus
* Future people
* False teachers
* And all believers who wait eagerly for Jesus to come back

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Paul is writing Paul's final instructions to Timothy before Paul's death. Paul knows that Paul must prepare Timothy to continue the work of ministry after Paul is gone. During that time period, when Greek culture influenced how people in many places did things, people used formal instructions like this when they appointed someone to an important position. Paul uses this formal language to show how serious these instructions are.

In the first part, Paul gives Timothy formal instructions. In that time, when a leader instructed a new leader like this, they often appointed the new leaders while other people watched as witnesses. In this case, Paul says that God and Christ are watching as witnesses. Paul talks about how Christ will come back to judge everyone who has ever lived. When Christ judges, Christ will evaluate both people who are still alive and people who have died. Christ will look at how people lived and give those people either rewards or consequences. Paul also reminds Timothy that Christ will return to Earth and rule Christ's kingdom. Paul mentions these things to remind Timothy that God's people serve God faithfully because those people know Christ will return and establish Christ's kingdom completely.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about a time when someone gave you very important instructions. How did that person show you that the instructions were serious? What words or actions did that person use? Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul gives Timothy five specific duties. Timothy must tell people the good news about Jesus. Timothy must share this message about Jesus all the time, both when people want to hear it and even when people do not want to hear it. Timothy needs to stay alert and be ready to share about Jesus whenever Timothy can. Timothy must help people understand when those people have sinned. Timothy must speak up when someone teaches something wrong about Jesus. Timothy must give people hope and encouragement. Timothy must stay patient and explain everything clearly when Timothy teaches these things.

In the third part, Paul warns about future dangers. People will grow tired of hearing and following Jesus' true teachings because these teachings tell people to stop doing what feels good to people. Paul says these people are like someone with itchy ears who wants to hear more and more new things. These people constantly want teachings that make people happy instead of teachings that help people grow. These people will gather many teachers who say pleasant things. These people will turn away from the truth and start to believe myths, or false stories.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: How have you seen people choose to believe things that make those people feel good instead of accepting harder truths? Why do you think those people made that choice? In your culture, how do you describe someone who always wants to hear nice things instead of hearing true things? Pause this audio here.

In the fourth part, Paul describes how God is pouring out Paul's life like an offering. In Jewish worship, people poured out wine along with other sacrifices in the temple. Paul is saying that God will pour out Paul's life like that wine offering, showing that Paul knows Paul will die soon. But Paul is satisfied with how Paul has lived Paul's life. Paul uses three pictures from Greek athletic competitions: fighting well in a contest, finishing a race, and keeping the competition rules. Paul uses these images to show how faithfully Paul has served God. Paul knows that Paul will receive a special crown. In Greek games, winners received a crown of leaves to show their victory. Paul says that Paul's crown will show that Paul has lived the right way before God. God will not give this reward only to Paul. God will give this reward to everyone who eagerly waits for Jesus to return.

Stop here and look at a photo of a crown that people might win at a Greek competition. Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: In your culture, what do you give to winners or people who succeed? What kinds of rewards or honors show that someone has done well? How would you describe the special reward God will give to those who live faithfully for God? Pause this audio here.

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. As you do this, you might want to use drawings, objects, or even people to represent Paul writing to Timothy, God and Christ as witnesses, Timothy teaching others, people turning away from truth to false teachers, and Paul as an athlete completing his race. Consider showing the contrast between Timothy's patient teaching and the false teachers saying what people want to hear.

Embodying the Text
------------------

Embodying the Text
------------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 4:1–8 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has four parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* God
* Christ Jesus
* Future people
* False teachers
* And all believers who wait eagerly for Jesus to come back

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul says, "I give you these serious instructions in front of God and Christ Jesus, who will judge everyone who is alive and everyone who has died. I tell you to do this because Jesus will return and rule as King."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am feeling sad as I give Timothy these instructions, because I know I will soon die and leave Timothy to carry on this work alone; or
* I want Timothy to remember that God and Christ are watching Timothy carry out these duties; or
* I am thinking about Jesus returning as Judge and King, and I want Timothy to keep this future event in his thoughts as Timothy works.

Paul says, "Preach God's message. Be ready, whether the time is good or bad. Correct people's errors, rebuke people's sins, and encourage people. Do all this with great patience and careful teaching."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel honored to be trusted with this responsibility, but I also feel inadequate for this work; or
* I understand I must be ready to teach at any time, even when people do not want to hear it; or
* I am nervous that I will experience the same things that Paul experienced.

Paul says, "The time will come when people will not listen to sound, or true, teaching. People will gather many teachers who tell people what they want to hear. People will not listen to the truth, and people will believe myths instead. But you must keep control of yourself in all situations. Be willing to suffer. Do the work of telling the good news. Complete all the duties of your ministry."

Pause the drama.

Ask the people playing the future people who reject truth, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The people might answer things like:

* We do not like this teaching because it challenges our desires; or
* We want to hear pleasant things, not hard truths; or
* Let's find teachers who will say what makes us comfortable.

Paul says, "As for me, my life is being poured out like a drink offering. The time has come for my departure. I have fought the good fight, finished the race, and kept the faith. Now there is a crown of righteousness waiting for me, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me on that day. And not just to me, but to all who have longed for Jesus to appear again."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I see my death as completing my service to God, like a final offering; or
* I am satisfied because I have been faithful to my calling; or
* I look forward to receiving my reward from Jesus, along with all other faithful believers.

Ask the person playing Christ Jesus, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I see Timothy's heart and how much Timothy loves me. I know this will be hard for Timothy after Paul dies, but I will help Timothy stay strong. I chose Timothy for this work, and I will give Timothy what Timothy needs to do this work; or
* I am the fair Judge who will reward all who have served faithfully; or
* I want all believers to look forward to my return with hope.

Filling the Gaps

Filling the Gaps
----------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 4:1–8 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

**Christ** appears at the start of this passage in the name "Christ Jesus," who will judge the living and the dead. Christ means the Messiah, God's chosen one. For more information on Christ, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word for Christ as you have in previous passages.

Christ will **judge**, which means that Christ has the authority to decide about right and wrong. Christ will do this when Christ returns. The early church taught that Christ has power over everyone and will judge everyone. This judgment will happen soon and with certainty. Paul also calls Christ "a judge," because Christ judges between what is right and what is wrong.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for judge. How do people in your culture describe both the person who has the power and authority to make final decisions about right and wrong, and the action that person does when they decide what is right and what is wrong? Refer to the Master Glossary for more information about judge. Pause this audio here.

The **kingdom** appears when Christ comes. A kingdom means a place where a king rules. In this passage, the kingdom refers to two things. First, it means the salvation believers experience now. Second, it means the final victory when Christ returns as the universal ruler. In this case, the kingdom here refers to what other New Testament authors call the Kingdom of God.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **kingdom**. For more information on kingdom, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word for kingdom as you have in previous books of the Bible. Pause this audio here.

Paul tells Timothy to preach the **word**, which in this case means that Timothy should preach the good news about Jesus. Use the same word or phrase for word that you have used in previous passages, and refer to the Master Glossary for more information about word.

Timothy must **correct** people who are in error. When someone corrects mistakes, that person is revealing sin and bringing people to the point of understanding their mistakes. This is the first step in helping someone return to the truth.

Timothy must **rebuke** sin. This means to challenge someone's error openly and publicly. In the early church, people mainly rebuked members who had sinned and needed correction. This term describes a formal charge or accusation.

Timothy must **encourage** believers. The Greek word includes teaching, giving hope, and urging people to live rightly. Paul uses this term throughout his letters to describe the kind of teaching that helps believers grow stronger in their faith.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **correct**, **rebuke**, and **encourage**. How do people in your culture help others recognize and fix their mistakes? What words show the difference between pointing out error, challenging wrong behavior, and giving hope? Pause this audio here.

Paul says that one day people will not believe sound, or true, **doctrine**. Doctrine is teaching that shows believers how to live healthy spiritual lives. Apostles like Paul taught doctrine. People will reject this teaching or doctrine because people want to hear different messages that please them. These people will search for many teachers who say what these people like to hear. These people will abandon the truth and believe made\-up stories instead.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **doctrine**. How do people in your culture describe teachings that give spiritual health? What words show the difference between true teachings and false teachings that just make people feel good? For more information on doctrine, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word for doctrine as you have in previous books of the Bible. Pause this audio here.

In the last days, people will turn away and stop believing the truth, but they will believe **myths**, or false stories. Sometimes these false stories try to explain the reasons for the way things are. However, myths are not true.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use to describe **myths**, or false stories. How will you show that these myths are the opposite of truth? Pause this audio here.

Timothy will face **hardship** in Timothy's ministry. This term describes suffering for the sake of the gospel. Paul uses the same word to describe Paul's own suffering for Christ. This term shows that following Jesus often involves difficulty and opposition.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you can use in your language to describe the ideas of "suffering through hardship." How do you describe facing difficulty because of what you believe? Pause this audio here.

Timothy must do the work of an **evangelist**. An evangelist is someone who announces the good news about Jesus. An evangelist is someone who travels to different places to tell people about Jesus. In the early church, evangelists worked alongside apostles but had a different role. An apostle's work included both sharing the message with people outside the church and teaching people inside the church.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **evangelist**. For more information on evangelist, refer to the Master Glossary. If you have already translated the idea of an evangelist in another book of the Bible, use similar language here. Pause this audio here.

Paul says that God is pouring Paul out like a **drink offering**. Jewish people gave offerings of wine in the temple along with their other sacrifices to complete their sacrifices.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will describe the **drink offering**. Refer to the Master Glossary for more information about drink offering. Pause this audio here.

**Faith** means trusting God completely. Faith includes believing in Jesus Christ and following Jesus' teachings. People with faith show it through both their beliefs and their actions. For more information on faith, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word for faith as you have in previous passages.

Paul mentions that the righteous **Lord** Jesus will give Paul the crown of **righteousness** because the Lord is righteous, or good, and Paul has a good relationship with Jesus. Therefore, Paul is righteous. For more information on righteousness and Lord, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same words or phrases for righteousness and for Lord as you used in previous passages.

Pause this audio here.

In this final part of Paul's letter, Paul gives information about Paul's team members and their movements. Paul also shares details about Paul's recent trial in Rome.

Paul tells Timothy to come quickly to see Paul in Rome. Paul needs Timothy to come because many of Paul's team members have left. Demas has left Paul. Demas wanted comfortable living, so Demas went to Thessalonica. Crescens and Titus have not abandoned Paul but have gone to work somewhere else. Crescens leads the ministry in Galatia, a region in what we now call central Turkey. Titus leads the ministry in Dalmatia, along the coast of the Adriatic Sea in what we now call Croatia. Titus has worked with Paul for many years as one of Paul's most trusted partners in ministry. Before going to Dalmatia, Titus helped Paul with the churches in Corinth and served as a leader in Crete.

Stop here and look at a map of the [area of the Mediterranean that shows Rome, where Paul is, Ephesus, where Timothy is, Thessalonica, Galatia, Dalmatia, and Troas, where Timothy needs to stop on the way to Rome](#c). Pause this audio here.

Luke stays with Paul in Rome. Luke became one of Paul's closest friends and co\-workers many years ago. Luke worked as a doctor and traveled with Paul on many of Paul's missionary trips. When Paul experienced shipwrecks, riots, and imprisonment, Luke remained by Paul's side. Now in Rome, Luke continues to support Paul through this difficult time.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: What are some ways people today might choose the comforts of this world over serving God? Pause this audio here.

Paul wants Timothy to bring Mark with Timothy. Mark will be helpful to Paul in Paul's ministry. Mark had left Paul's team earlier in their ministry. Back then, Mark's departure had caused conflict between Paul and Barnabas. But over time, Mark proved that Mark was faithful, and now Paul trusts Mark as a valuable worker. Timothy is currently serving in Ephesus, and Paul tells Timothy that Tychicus has gone to Ephesus too. Based on Paul's other letters, we know Tychicus often carried Paul's messages to churches. Tychicus might have brought this letter to Timothy, or Tychicus might have traveled to Ephesus separately to help with the church there.

Paul asks Timothy to make a special stop on Timothy's way to Rome. Timothy will travel through the port city of Troas. Paul preached in Troas several times before. A Gentile Christian named Carpus welcomed Paul into Carpus' home during one of these visits. Paul chose to store some important belongings with Carpus. Paul needs Paul's heavy outer garment from Carpus. Travelers relied on these cloaks to protect them. Skilled workers made these cloaks from thick goat hair or wool. A traveler like Paul used a cloak as a coat during cold days and as a blanket at night. Most people could buy only one of these expensive garments.

Paul asks Timothy to bring Paul's writing materials, too. Paul wants the papyrus scrolls and notebooks made of animal skin. Writers used papyrus scrolls for longer documents in those days. Writers preferred skin notebooks for shorter writings and personal notes. These materials probably contained parts of Scripture, early Christian documents, and Paul's own writings. Paul loved to study Scripture and wanted these precious materials with Paul, even in prison.

Stop here and look at photos of scrolls, parchment, and a cloak as a group. Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about the items Paul asked for. What do these requests tell us about Paul's situation in prison? Pause this audio here.

Paul warns Timothy about Alexander the metalworker. This Alexander might be the same Alexander who caused trouble in Ephesus earlier. A group of metalworkers worked in Troas at that time, and Paul may be thinking that Alexander is in Troas now. Paul says Alexander has hurt Paul badly. The text does not explain what Alexander did. Some scholars believe Alexander made false claims to Roman leaders about Paul, which led the leaders to arrest Paul.

Paul declares that the Lord will pay Alexander back for what Alexander has done. Jewish scriptures and teachers had taught their people to trust God to handle people who hurt them in this way. When Paul says "the Lord," Paul means Jesus Christ. Paul warns Timothy to watch out for Alexander. Paul explains that Alexander fights hard against their message about Jesus.

After Paul asks Timothy to bring Paul some things, Paul tells Timothy about Paul's first hearing in a Roman court. The court would typically hold this type of initial hearing to decide if enough evidence existed for a full trial. Supporters would normally stand with the accused person to provide testimony and moral support. However, Paul stood completely alone that day. Everyone who could have defended Paul had abandoned Paul. Even though this abandonment hurt Paul deeply, Paul responds with grace. Paul prays that God will not count this desertion against those people who left Paul. Jesus Christ stayed right by Paul's side, even when no one else supported Paul.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Why do you think no one came to support Paul at Paul's trial? When everyone abandons Paul at his trial, Paul responds by focusing on how Jesus Christ stood with Paul and gave Paul strength. What does Paul's response tell us about Paul's character? Pause this audio here.

Because the Lord helped Paul, Paul could fully proclaim his message. Paul sees this as completing Paul's mission to the Gentiles, or non\-Jews. Rome was the center of the Gentile world because it was the capital of the Roman Empire. By preaching in Rome, Paul believes that Paul has reached all nations with the gospel.

Paul says the Lord rescued Paul from "the lion's mouth." These words come from an ancient psalm that Jesus quoted during his suffering. Paul picks up many phrases from this psalm as Paul writes about his own troubles. This shows Paul sees his own trials as similar to what Jesus went through. When Paul talks about "the lion's mouth," Paul means the threat of death. Paul does not mean actual lions. Romans did sometimes throw prisoners to lions in the arena as punishment. However, Paul uses the lion as a picture of deadly danger.

Paul might mean that Paul survived his first court hearing and the Romans did not throw Paul to the lions. Or Paul might mean Jesus gave Paul spiritual strength even though Paul remained in physical danger. By using words from this old psalm, Paul links Paul's suffering to two important things. Paul connects to the ancient Jewish way of praying during hard times, and Paul connects his experience to how Jesus suffered. When Paul says "the Lord" rescued him, Paul means Jesus Christ helped Paul.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when you felt alone in a difficult situation. How did knowing God was with you help you face that challenge? Pause this audio here.

As in all of Paul's letters, Paul ends by sending greetings to Priscilla and Aquila. These were Jewish Christians who worked with Paul in several cities. Paul also greets the household of Onesiphorus. We do not know if Onesiphorus lived at this time, since Paul only mentions Onesiphorus' household. Paul tells Timothy that Erastus remains in Corinth. This Erastus might be the same person who served as Corinth's city treasurer and had worked with Timothy before. Paul mentions that Paul left Trophimus sick in Miletus. Trophimus came from Ephesus and had traveled with Paul before. Trophimus was a Gentile, a non\-Jewish believer. Trophimus' presence with Paul in Jerusalem once caused problems when some people accused Paul of bringing Gentiles into restricted temple areas.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Paul worked with many different people in different places to spread the gospel. How do believers in different places work together today to share about Jesus? Pause this audio here.

Paul again asks Timothy to come before winter. Winter travel was dangerous by land and impossible by sea. If Timothy waited too long, Timothy might not be able to reach Paul until spring. Even though many people abandoned Paul at his trial, Paul has made new friends among the Roman believers. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, and Claudia want Timothy to know they send greetings. These believers likely met Paul after Paul's imprisonment in Rome. These believers are different from Paul's mission team members, who left Paul. All the other Roman believers also send their greetings to Timothy.

Paul ends with two blessings. First, Paul asks the Lord to be with Timothy's spirit. Paul refers to Timothy's spirit as that part of human life that can connect with God. This is the deep inner part of a person that can have a relationship with God. This blessing matches the challenging tasks that Timothy must face ahead. Then Paul asks for God's grace to be with all the believers. This second blessing includes the whole church that will hear this letter.

Defining the Scenes

Defining the Scenes
-------------------

Listen to an audio version of 2 Timothy 4:9–22 in the easiest\-to\-understand translation.

Pause this audio here.

In this step, the group will define the parts, characters, and setting of this passage. Then the group will visualize this passage.

This passage has five parts.

**In the first part:** Paul asks Timothy to come to Rome quickly and explains where Paul's team members went.

**In the second part:** Paul also asks Timothy to bring specific items Paul needs, and then Paul warns Timothy about Alexander the metalworker and the harm Alexander has done.

**In the third part:** Paul describes Paul's first defense in court and how everyone abandoned Paul. But Paul also describes how the Lord stood with Paul and strengthened Paul.

**In the fourth part:** Paul sends greetings to believers and shares information about where other team members are located.

**In the fifth part:** Paul gives Paul's final blessings to Timothy and all the believers.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* Demas
* Crescens
* Titus
* Luke
* Mark
* Tychicus
* Carpus
* Alexander the metalworker
* Priscilla
* Aquila
* Onesiphorus' household
* Erastus
* Trophimus
* Eubulus
* Pudens
* Linus
* Claudia
* The Lord Jesus Christ
* And all the believers in Rome

As a group, pay attention to these parts of the passage's setting:

Paul is in prison in Rome. Paul has already had one court hearing and expects more to come. Most of Paul's team members have left Paul. Some left for ministry work in other places.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Think about what it would be like to be in prison in ancient Rome. What would you want your friends to bring you? What words or phrases would you use to describe the things or people you missed the most? Pause this audio here.

In the first part of this passage, Paul urgently asks Timothy to come see Paul. Paul says, "Do your best to come quickly." Paul then explains why Paul needs Timothy. Demas has deserted Paul because Demas loves "this present world," or the comfortable life that someone can have in the world. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus has gone to Dalmatia. Only Luke stays with Paul.

Paul wants Timothy to bring Mark with Timothy. Earlier in their ministry, Mark had left Paul's team. Now Paul trusts Mark and says Mark is helpful in ministry. Paul also tells Timothy that Paul sent Tychicus to Ephesus. Paul might mean several things when Paul says "sent." Tychicus might carry this very letter to Timothy in Ephesus. Or Tychicus might have traveled to Ephesus earlier on another mission from Paul. We cannot know for sure when or why Paul sent Tychicus. Tychicus had carried Paul's letters before and had traveled with Paul from Greece to Jerusalem.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when you had to choose between staying comfortable and doing something difficult that you knew was right. What words or phrases would you use to describe someone who chooses comfort over doing what is right? What words or phrases would you use to describe someone who gives up comfort to do what is right? Pause this audio here.

In the second part, Paul asks Timothy to bring specific items. Paul tells us that Paul stayed in Troas earlier and that Paul left his belongings in Troas with a man named Carpus. Paul left his cloak in Troas with Carpus, and Paul wants Timothy to pick this cloak up for Paul. Paul also wants Paul's scrolls and parchments. These might have included parts of the Old Testament, other Christian writings, and Paul's personal notebooks.

Paul brings up Alexander the metalworker right after mentioning Troas because Alexander may live in Troas. Paul wants Timothy to be careful when Timothy stops in Troas to collect Paul's belongings. Paul says that Alexander caused Paul great personal harm. Though we do not know exactly what Alexander did, Paul's strong words show that something serious and direct happened. When Paul says the Lord will repay Alexander according to Alexander's deeds, Paul uses words that Paul's readers would recognize from the Psalms. Paul chooses these familiar words to show that Paul trusts God to handle the punishment rather than seeking revenge himself. Paul shows us how to follow God's teaching even when someone has caused deep hurt.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when someone hurt you deeply and personally. What words or phrases would you use to describe how that harm felt? Paul describes Alexander's actions as "great harm" but trusts God for justice. What words or phrases would you use to describe Paul's response to being hurt? What words or phrases would you use to describe the difference between seeking revenge and trusting God to handle justice? Pause this audio here.

In the third part, Paul describes Paul's first defense in court. No one came to support Paul during this hearing. When Paul tells Timothy what happened, Paul strongly says that everyone "abandoned" Paul. Paul chose this strong description for a reason. Paul's friends did not just stay away, but they completely left Paul alone when Paul needed these friends most. But Paul does not want God to hold this against these friends or punish them. Instead of human help, the Lord stood with Paul and gave Paul strength.

Stop here and discuss this question as a group: Tell a story about a time when you felt completely alone or when people you counted on were not there for you. What words or phrases would you use to describe how that felt? Pause this audio here.

Paul says the Lord rescued Paul from "the lion's mouth." When Paul says "lion's mouth," Paul talks about facing death. Paul does not mean real lions. Paul uses these special words to show that Paul's suffering is like how Jesus suffered.

Stop here and look at photos of lions as a group. Think about how dangerous lions could be! Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss these questions as a group: Tell a story about a time when you faced great danger. What words or phrases would you use in your language to describe being saved from danger? Pause this audio here.

Paul says Jesus will bring Paul safely into Jesus' heavenly kingdom. Paul knows that Paul will die soon, but Paul sees Jesus taking Paul home to heaven. Paul talks about this like a safe journey. Even though people will kill Paul, Paul describes it as Jesus leading Paul safely home.

Stop here and discuss these questions as a group: Tell a story about returning home after a dangerous journey. What words or phrases would you use in your language to describe arriving safely home? Pause this audio here.

In the fourth part, Paul sends greetings from believers in Rome. Paul names both men and women. Claudia and Priscilla are women. Eubulus, Pudens, and Linus are men. Paul then says that "all the brothers" send greetings. At that time, "brothers" referred to both men and women. This shows both men and women belonged to the early church. Paul worked with both men and women throughout Paul's ministry.

Stop here and discuss these questions as a group: Tell a story about how men and women work together in your church community. What words or phrases would you use in your language to show that both men and women belong to God's family? What words or phrases would you use to describe a community where both men and women serve God together? Pause this audio here.

Paul then ends Paul's letter to Timothy with a typical greeting and blessing. Paul asks for the Lord Jesus to be with Timothy's spirit. In other words, Paul wants the Lord Jesus to be close to Timothy. Paul wishes that Jesus gives everyone in the church his grace. Paul knows that Jesus is kind to his people, even though we do not deserve Jesus' kindness!

Now, the group should storyboard, draw, or use objects to visualize the passage and the action in it. As you do this, you might want to use drawings, objects, or even people to represent Paul in prison, Timothy receiving the letter, the various team members in different locations, and Paul standing alone at his trial with the Lord beside Paul. Consider showing the contrast between Demas leaving for worldly comfort and Paul trusting God in Paul's difficult situation.

In this step, the group will dramatize the passage.

This passage has five parts.

The characters in this passage are:

* Paul
* Timothy
* Demas
* Crescens
* Titus
* Luke
* Mark
* Tychicus
* Carpus
* Alexander the metalworker
* Priscilla
* Aquila
* Onesiphorus' household

* And all the believers in Rome

As a group, act out the passage twice. You should act out the passage in your own language.

First, act out the passage without stopping. Pay attention to the dialogue, flow, plotline, and chronology of the passage. Make sure you do not skip acting out the difficult or important parts of the passage. Help each other remember every part of the passage.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage.

The group should act out this passage a second time. At certain points in the drama, pause the drama and ask the person playing the character, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person playing the character should answer what they would be feeling or thinking if they were that character. Then continue the drama.

Pause this audio here and act out the passage a second time.

The following is an example of the drama and possible responses.

Paul writes to Timothy, "Do your best to come to me quickly. Demas has deserted me because he loves this present world, and Demas has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because Mark is helpful to me in my ministry. I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I feel lonely with most of my friends gone. I really want Timothy to come quickly; or
* I am disappointed that Demas chose comfort over serving Christ; or
* I am cold in this prison and need my warm cloak. I want to study my scrolls while I wait.

Ask the person playing Demas, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* Following Paul is too hard. I want an easier life; or
* I am afraid to associate with a prisoner who might be executed.

Paul says, "Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay Alexander for what Alexander has done. You should also be on your guard against Alexander, because Alexander strongly opposed our message."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Alexander, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I want to stop Paul's message from spreading, so I will also cause trouble for Timothy! or
* If more people believe Paul's message, I might lose my business making idols; or
* Paul's confidence and authority make me feel small and threatened.

Ask the person playing Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I am worried about facing Alexander's opposition; or
* I trust that God will protect me like God protected Paul; or
* I need to be careful and guard against people who oppose the gospel; or
* I am grateful Paul taught me how to handle opposition without seeking revenge.

Paul says, "At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them. But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me God might proclaim his message and all the Gentiles might hear it. And God delivered me from the lion's mouth. The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I felt so alone when no one supported me at my trial; or
* But God's presence gave me courage to keep preaching; or
* I trust God will save me even if I die in prison.

Ask the person playing the Lord, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I love Paul! I will never abandon my servant Paul; or
* Paul has shown great love and faithfulness to me; or
* I will give Paul strength to complete Paul's mission.

Paul concludes, "Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus. Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus. Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers and sisters. The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you all."

Pause the drama.

Ask the person playing Paul, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I care deeply about all these believers and want to send my greetings; or
* I hope Timothy arrives before the winter weather makes travel impossible; or
* I want to be with these people, but because I cannot, I will give a special blessing to Timothy and all the believers.

Ask the person playing Timothy, "What are you feeling or thinking?" The person might answer things like:

* I need to hurry to reach Paul before winter makes travel dangerous; or
* I am encouraged that other believers send their greetings; or
* I am touched by Paul's personal blessing for me.

In this step, the group will discuss key terms and words in this passage.

Paul tells Timothy to come before **winter**. Winter was a dangerous time for travel in the ancient world. The word refers to the cold season when storms made sea travel impossible and land travel very dangerous.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **winter**. What words in your language describe a season when travel becomes dangerous? Pause this audio here.

People do **ministry** or serve God by telling people the good news about Jesus. When Paul talks about Mark helping with this service, Paul means that Mark helped Paul spread the good news. This includes teaching people, caring for believers, starting new churches, and sharing God's message. Mark will not just help Paul with daily tasks. Paul uses this same word in all Paul's letters when Paul talks about the full work of serving God's people and sharing God's message.

Stop here and discuss as a group how you will talk about **ministry**, or service to God. Pause this audio here.

Paul asks Timothy to bring Paul's **cloak**. A cloak was a heavy coat made from goat hair, hide, or thick wool. People used it to stay warm in cold weather. Most people owned only one cloak because a cloak cost a lot of money. Travelers like Paul needed a cloak to keep warm and to use as a blanket while sleeping.

Stop here and look at the photo of a cloak again if needed. Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **cloak**. Look up cloak in the Master Glossary for more information. If you have already translated this word in another book of the Bible, use the same word that you have used there. Pause this audio here.

The **scrolls** and **parchments** were different types of written materials. People made scrolls by rolling up papyrus plant material. Workers made parchments from animal skins and could roll or fold them into book form.

Stop here and look at photos of scrolls and parchment again if needed. Pause this audio here.

Stop here and discuss as a group what words or phrases you will use for **scrolls** and **parchments**. Pause this audio here.

Paul refers to Alexander the **metalworker**, but the historical record does not specify what type of metalwork Alexander practiced. Alexander could have worked with bronze, copper, or other metals common during the Roman period.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use to describe the type of work that Alexander did. Pause this audio here.

Paul writes about the Lord standing with Paul. The word **Lord** here means Jesus Christ. For more information on Lord, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word for Lord as you have in previous passages.

Paul had Paul's first **defense**. This word refers to formally defending oneself in court against accusations. Defense was a technical legal term for the first hearing to decide if there was enough evidence for a trial.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **defense**. What words in your language describe defending yourself against accusations in court? Pause this audio here.

The word **Gentiles** means all people who are not Jewish. Paul had a special mission to tell Gentiles about Jesus. Rome was an important city for reaching Gentiles.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **Gentiles**. What words in your language describe all people outside your own cultural group? How do you talk about people from every nation and culture together as one group? For more information on Gentiles, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word for Gentiles as you have in other books of the Bible. Pause this audio here.

Paul says that the Lord will rescue Paul from **evil** attack, or evil actions. Use the same word for evil that you have used in previous passages, and refer to the Master Glossary for more information about evil.

The Lord will bring Paul safely to God's **heavenly kingdom**. The heavenly kingdom refers to God's eternal rule and the place where believers will live with God after death. For more information on kingdom and heaven, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for kingdom as you used in previous passages. If you use the term for heaven, or the place where God lives, use the same term for heaven as you have used previously.

**Amen** is a word that means "this is true." People say Amen to show they agree with what was said. Paul uses Amen at the end of Paul's prayer to God. For more information on Amen, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word for Amen as you have in previous passages.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for **Amen**. For more information on Amen, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for Amen as you have in other books of the Bible. Pause this audio here.

Paul asks the Lord to be with Timothy's **spirit**. Spirit refers to the inner, spiritual part of a person that can relate to God. For more information on spirit, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word or phrase for spirit as you used in previous passages.

A **household** means all the people who live in one home. This includes family members. A household can also include servants and workers. Paul sends greetings to the household of Onesiphorus. For more information on household, refer to the Master Glossary. Use the same word for household as you have in previous passages.

**Brothers and sisters** means all the believers in a local church community. Christians call each other "brothers and sisters" because they are part of God's family. Paul uses this term when Paul sends greetings from all the Christians in Rome. In the past, people just said "brothers," but this term included both men and women.

Stop here and discuss as a group what word or phrase you will use for "brothers and sisters." What words in your language show that people belong to the same group or family? What terms show close relationships that are not based on blood relations? Translate this idea of "brothers," or "brothers and sisters," in the same way as you have in previous books of the Bible.
